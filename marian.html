                                            We are mindful of how missionaries<br>
                                            came with the power of Christ’s Gospel<br>
                                            and committed the success of their work to you.<br>
                                            As the Mother of Divine Grace<br>
                                            you were with the missionaries in all their efforts.<br>
                                            And as Mother of the Church<br>
                                            you presided over all the activities of evangeliztion<br>
                                            and over the implantation of the Gospel<br>
                                            in the hearts of the faithful.<br>
                                            You sustained the missionaries in hope<br>
                                            and you gave joy to every new community<br>
                                            that was born of the Church’s evangelizing activity.<br>
                                            You were there with your intercession and your prayers,<br>
                                            as the first grace of baptism developed,<br>
                                            and as those who had new life in Christ your Son<br>
                                            came to a full appreciation of their Christian calling.</p>
                                        <p>We ask you, Mary,<br>
                                            to help us to fulfill this mission of evangelization<br>
                                            which your Son has given to his Church<br>
                                            and which falls to us.<br>
                                            Mindful of your role as Help of Christians,<br>

                                            To Jesus Christ your Son,<br>
                                            with the Father,<br>
