    6. Oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free
thyself, from what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live
in fear, and in expectation of death!  Strive now to live in such
wise that in the hour of death thou mayest rather rejoice than
fear.  Learn now to die to the world, so shalt thou begin to live
with Christ.  Learn now to contemn all earthly things, and then
mayest thou freely go unto Christ.  Keep under thy body by
penitence, and then shalt thou be able to have a sure confidence.</p>

<p id="id00208" class="calibre1">7. Ah, foolish one!  why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long,
when thou art not sure of a single day?  How many have been
deceived, and suddenly have been snatched away from the body!
How many times hast thou heard how one was slain by the sword,
another was drowned, another falling from on high broke his neck,
another died at the table, another whilst at play! One died by
fire, another by the sword, another by the pestilence, another by
the robber.  Thus cometh death to all, and the life of men
swiftly passeth away like a shadow.</p>

<p id="id00209" class="calibre1">8. Who will remember thee after thy death?  And who will entreat
for thee?  Work, work now, oh dearly beloved, work all that thou
canst.  For thou knowest not when thou shalt die, nor what shall
happen unto thee after death.  While thou hast time, lay up for
thyself undying riches.  Think of nought but of thy salvation;
care only for the things of God.  Make to thyself friends, by
venerating the saints of God and walking in their steps, that
when thou failest, thou mayest be received into everlasting
habitations.(2)</p>

<p id="id00210" class="calibre1">9. Keep thyself as a stranger and a pilgrim upon the earth, to
whom the things of the world appertain not.  Keep thine heart
free, and lifted up towards God, for here have we no continuing
city.(3)  To Him direct thy daily prayers with crying and tears,
that thy spirit may be found worthy to pass happily after death
unto its Lord.  Amen.</p>

<p id="id00211" class="calibre1">(1) Matthew xxiv. 44.   (2) Luke xvi. 9.   (3) Hebrews xiii. 14.</p>

<h4 id="id00212" class="calibre12">CHAPTER XXIV</h4>

<p id="id00213" class="calibre1">Of the judgment and punishment of the wicked</p>

<p id="id00214" class="calibre1">In all that thou doest, remember the end, and how thou wilt stand
before a strict judge, from whom nothing is hid, who is not
bribed with gifts, nor accepteth excuses, but will judge
righteous judgment.  O most miserable and foolish sinner, who art
sometimes in fear of the countenance of an angry man, what wilt
thou answer to God, who knoweth all thy misdeeds?  Why dost thou
not provide for thyself against the day of judgment, when no man
shall be able to be excused or defended by means of another, but
each one shall bear his burden himself alone?  Now doth thy
labour bring forth fruit, now is thy weeping acceptable, thy
groaning heard, thy sorrow well pleasing to God, and cleansing to
thy soul.</p>

<p id="id00215" class="calibre1">2. Even here on earth the patient man findeth great occasion of
purifying his soul.  When suffering injuries he grieveth more for
the other's malice than for his own wrong; when he prayeth
heartily for those that despitefully use him, and forgiveth them
from his heart; when he is not slow to ask pardon from others;
when he is swifter to pity than to anger; when he frequently
denieth himself and striveth altogether to subdue the flesh to
the spirit.  Better is it now to purify the soul from sin, than
to cling to sins from which we must be purged hereafter.  Truly
we deceive ourselves by the inordinate love which we bear towards
the flesh.</p>

<p id="id00216" class="calibre1">3. What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins?  The
more thou sparest thyself and followest the flesh, the more heavy
shall thy punishment be, and the more fuel art thou heaping up
for the burning.  For wherein a man hath sinned, therein shall he
be the more heavily punished.  There shall the slothful be
pricked forward with burning goads, and the gluttons be tormented
with intolerable hunger and thirst.  There shall the luxurious
and the lovers of pleasure be plunged into burning pitch and
stinking brimstone, and the envious shall howl like mad dogs for
very grief.</p>

<p id="id00217" class="calibre1">4. No sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own
proper punishment. The proud shall be filled with utter
confusion, and the covetous shall be pinched with miserable
poverty.  An hour's pain there shall be more grievous than a
hundred years here of the bitterest penitence.  No quiet shall be
there, no comfort for the lost, though here sometimes there is
respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace of friends.  Be
thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the day of
judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed.  For then
shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face
of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his
labours.(1)  Then shall he stand up to judge, he who now
submitteth himself in humility to the judgments of men.  Then
shall the poor and humble man have great confidence, while the
proud is taken with fear on every side.</p>

<p id="id00218" class="calibre1">5. Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world
who learned to be a fool and despised for Christ.  Then shall all
tribulation patiently borne delight us, while the mouth of the
ungodly shall be stopped.  Then shall every godly man rejoice,
and every profane man shall mourn.  Then the afflicted flesh
shall more rejoice than if it had been alway nourished in
delights.  Then the humble garment shall put on beauty, and the
precious robe shall hide itself as vile.  Then the little poor
cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace.  Then
enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the
world.  Then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than
all worldly wisdom.</p>

<p id="id00219" class="calibre1">6. Then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than
learned philosophy.  Then contempt of riches shall have more
weight than all the treasure of the children of this world.  Then
shalt thou find more comfort in having prayed devoutly than in
having fared sumptuously.  Then thou wilt rather rejoice in
having kept silence than in having made long speech.  Then holy
deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words.  Then a strict
life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all
earthly delight.  Learn now to suffer a little, that then thou
mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings.  Prove first
here, what thou art able to endure hereafter.  If now thou art
able to bear so little, how wilt thou be able to endure eternal
torments?  If now a little suffering maketh thee so impatient,
what shall hell-fire do then? Behold of a surety thou art not
able to have two Paradises, to take thy fill or delight here in
this world, and to reign with Christ hereafter.</p>

<p id="id00220" class="calibre1">7. If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and
pleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to
thee in an instant?  All therefore is vanity, save to love God
and to serve Him only.  For he who loveth God with all his heart
feareth not death, nor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell,
because perfect love giveth sure access to God.  But he who still
delighteth in sin, no marvel if he is afraid of death and
judgment.  Nevertheless it is a good thing, if love as yet cannot
restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of hell should
hold thee back.  But he who putteth aside the fear of God cannot
long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of
the devil.</p>

<p id="id00221" class="calibre1">(1) Wisd. v. 1.</p>

<h4 id="id00222" class="calibre12">CHAPTER XXV</h4>

<p id="id00223" class="calibre1">Of the zealous amendment of our whole life</p>

<p id="id00224" class="calibre1">Be thou watchful and diligent in God's service, and bethink thee
often why thou hast renounced the world.  Was it not that thou
mightest live to God and become a spiritual man?  Be zealous,
therefore, for thy spiritual profit, for thou shalt receive
shortly the reward of thy labours, and neither fear nor sorrow
shall come any more into thy borders.  Now shalt thou labour a
little, and thou shalt find great rest, yea everlasting joy.  If
thou shalt remain faithful and zealous in labour, doubt not that
God shall be faithful and bountiful in rewarding thee.  It is thy
duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the victory, but
thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful or
lifted up.</p>

<p id="id00225" class="calibre1">2. A certain man being in anxiety of mind, continually tossed
about between hope and fear, and being on a certain day
overwhelmed with grief, cast himself down in prayer before the
altar in a church, and meditated within himself, saying, "Oh! if
I but knew that I should still persevere," and presently heard
within him a voice from God, "And if thou didst know it, what
wouldst thou do?  Do now what thou wouldst do then, and thou
shalt be very secure."  And straightway being comforted and
strengthened, he committed himself to the will of God and the
perturbation of spirit ceased, neither had he a mind any more to
search curiously to know what should befall him hereafter, but
studied rather to inquire what was the good and acceptable will
of God, for the beginning and perfecting of every good work.</p>

<p id="id00226" class="calibre1">3. Hope in the Lord and be doing good, saith the Prophet; dwell
in the land and thou shalt be fed(1) with its riches.  One thing
there is which holdeth back many from progress and fervent
amendment, even the dread of difficulty, or the labour of the
conflict.  Nevertheless they advance above all others in virtue
who strive manfully to conquer those things which are most
grievous and contrary to them, for there a man profiteth most and
meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and
mortifieth himself in spirit.</p>

<p id="id00227" class="calibre1">4. But all men have not the same passions to conquer and to
mortify, yet he who is diligent shall attain more profit,
although he have stronger passions, than another who is more
temperate of disposition, but is withal less fervent in the
pursuit of virtue.  Two things specially avail unto improvement
in holiness, namely firmness to withdraw ourselves from the sin
to which by nature we are most inclined, and earnest zeal for
that good in which we are most lacking.  And strive also very
earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults which
displease thee most frequently in others.</p>

<p id="id00228" class="calibre1">5. Gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art, and wherever
thou seest or hearest good examples, stir thyself to follow them,
but where thou seest anything which is blameworthy, take heed
that thou do not the same; or if at any time thou hast done it,
strive quickly to amend thyself.  As thine eye observeth others,
so again are the eyes of others upon thee.  How sweet and
pleasant is it to see zealous and godly brethren temperate and of
good discipline; and how sad is it and grievous to see them
walking disorderly, not practising the duties to which they are
called. How hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose of their
calling, and turn their inclinations to things which are none of
their business.</p>

<p id="id00229" class="calibre1">6. Be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken, and set
always before thee the remembrance of the Crucified.  Truly
oughtest thou to be ashamed as thou lookest upon the life of
Jesus Christ, because thou hast not yet endeavoured to conform
thyself more unto Him, though thou hast been a long time in the
way of God.  A religious man who exercises himself seriously and
devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our Lord shall find
there abundantly all things that are profitable and necessary for
him, neither is there need that he shall seek anything better
beyond Jesus.  Oh! if Jesus crucified would come into our hearts,
how quickly, and completely should we have learned all that we
need to know!</p>

<p id="id00230" class="calibre1">7. He who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that
are laid upon him.  He who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble
upon trouble, and suffereth anguish upon every side, because he
is without inward consolation, and is forbidden to seek that
which is outward.  He who is living without discipline is exposed
to grievous ruin.  He who seeketh easier and lighter discipline
shall always be in distress, because one thing or another will
give him displeasure.</p>

<p id="id00231" class="calibre1">8. O! if no other duty lay upon us but to praise the Lord our God
with our whole heart and voice!  Oh! if thou never hadst need to
eat or drink, or sleep, but wert always able to praise God, and
to give thyself to spiritual exercises alone; then shouldst thou
be far happier than now, when for so many necessities thou must
serve the flesh.  O! that these necessities were not, but only
the spiritual refreshments of the soul, which alas we taste too
seldom.</p>

<p id="id00232" class="calibre1">9. When a man hath come to this, that he seeketh comfort from no
created thing, then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy God, then
also will he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto
him.  Then will he neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for
little, but he committeth himself altogether and with full trust
unto God, who is all in all to him, to whom nothing perisheth nor
dieth, but all things live to Him and obey His every word
without delay.</p>

<p id="id00233" class="calibre1">10. Remember always thine end, and how the time which is lost
returneth not.  Without care and diligence thou shalt never get
virtue.  If thou beginnest to grow cold, it shall begin to go ill
with thee, but if thou givest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find
much peace, and shalt find thy labour the lighter because of the
grace of God and the love of virtue.  A zealous and diligent
man is ready for all things.  It is greater labour to resist sins
and passions than to toil in bodily labours.  He who shunneth not
small faults falleth little by little into greater.  At eventide
thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day profitably.
Watch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself, and
howsoever it be with others, neglect not thyself. The more
violence thou dost unto thyself, the more thou shall profit.
Amen.</p>

<div class="calibre9"></div><h2 id="id00235" class="calibre10">THE SECOND BOOK</h2>

<h3 id="id00236" class="calibre11">ADMONITIONS CONCERNING THE INNER LIFE</h3>

<h5 id="id00237" class="calibre4">CHAPTER I</h5>

<p id="id00238" class="calibre1">Of the inward life</p>

<p id="id00239" class="calibre1">The kingdom of God is within you,(1) saith the Lord.  Turn thee
with all thine heart to the Lord and forsake this miserable
world, and thou shalt find rest unto thy soul.  Learn to despise
outward things and to give thyself to things inward, and thou
shalt see the kingdom of God come within thee.  For the kingdom
of God is peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and it is not given to
the wicked.  Christ will come to thee, and show thee His
consolation, if thou prepare a worthy mansion for Him within
thee.  All His glory and beauty is from within, and there it
pleaseth Him to dwell.  He often visiteth the inward man and
holdeth with him sweet discourse, giving him soothing
consolation, much peace, friendship exceeding wonderful.</p>

<p id="id00240" class="calibre1">2. Go to, faithful soul, prepare thy heart for this bridegroom
that he may vouchsafe to come to thee and dwell within thee, for
so He saith, if any man loveth me he will keep my words: and my
Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our
abode with him.(2)  Give, therefore, place to Christ and refuse
entrance to all others.  When thou hast Christ, thou art rich,
and hast sufficient.  He shall be thy provider and faithful
watchman in all things, so that thou hast no need to trust in
men, for men soon change and swiftly pass away, but Christ
remaineth for ever and standeth by us firmly even to the end.</p>

<p id="id00241" class="calibre1">3. There is no great trust to be placed in a frail and mortal
man, even though he be useful and dear to us, neither should
much sorrow arise within us if sometimes he oppose and contradict
us.  They who are on thy side to-day, may to-morrow be against
thee, and often are they turned round like the wind. Put thy
whole trust in God and let Him be thy fear and thy love, He will
answer for thee Himself, and will do for thee what is best.  Here
hast thou no continuing city,(3)  and wheresoever thou art, thou
art a stranger and a pilgrim, and thou shalt never have rest
unless thou art closely united to Christ within thee.</p>

<p id="id00242" class="calibre1">4. Why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither, since this
is not the place of thy rest?  In heaven ought thy habitation to
be, and all earthly things should be looked upon as it were in
the passing by.  All things pass away and thou equally with them.
Look that thou cleave not to them lest thou be taken with them
and perish.  Let thy contemplation be on the Most High, and let
thy supplication be directed unto Christ without ceasing.  If
thou canst not behold high and heavenly things, rest thou in the
passion of Christ and dwell willingly in His sacred wounds.  For
if thou devoutly fly to the wounds of Jesus, and the precious
marks of the nails and the spear, thou shalt find great comfort
in tribulation, nor will the slights of men trouble thee much,
and thou wilt easily bear their unkind words.</p>

<p id="id00243" class="calibre1">5. Christ also, when He was in the world, was despised and
rejected of men, and in His greatest necessity was left by His
acquaintance and friends to bear these reproaches.  Christ was
willing to suffer and be despised, and darest thou complain of
any?  Christ had adversaries and gainsayers, and dost thou wish
to have all men thy friends and benefactors?  Whence shall thy
patience attain her crown if no adversity befall thee?  If thou
art unwilling to suffer any adversity, how shalt thou be the
friend of Christ?  Sustain thyself with Christ and for Christ if
thou wilt reign with Christ.</p>

<p id="id00244" class="calibre1">6. If thou hadst once entered into the mind of Jesus, and hadst
tasted yea even a little of his tender love, then wouldst thou
care nought for thine own convenience or inconvenience, but
wouldst rather rejoice at trouble brought upon thee, because the
love of Jesus maketh a man to despise himself.  He who loveth
Jesus, and is inwardly true and free from inordinate affections,
is able to turn himself readily unto God, and to rise above
himself in spirit, and to enjoy fruitful peace.</p>

<p id="id00245" class="calibre1">7. He who knoweth things as they are and not as they are said or
seem to be, he truly is wise, and is taught of God more than of
men. He who knoweth how to walk from within, and to set little
value upon outward things, requireth not places nor waiteth for
seasons, for holding his intercourse with God.  The inward man
quickly recollecteth himself, because he is never entirely given
up to outward things.  No outward labour and no necessary
occupations stand in his way, but as events fall out, so doth he
fit himself to them.  He who is rightly disposed and ordered
within careth not for the strange and perverse conduct of men.  A
man is hindered and distracted in so far as he is moved by
outward things.</p>

<p id="id00246" class="calibre1">8. If it were well with thee, and thou wert purified from evil,
all things would work together for thy good and profiting.  For
this cause do many things displease thee and often trouble thee,
that thou art not yet perfectly dead to thyself nor separated
from all earthly things.  Nothing so defileth and entangleth the
heart of man as impure love towards created things.  If thou
rejectest outward comfort thou wilt be able to contemplate
heavenly things and frequently to be joyful inwardly.</p>

<p id="id00247" class="calibre1">(1) Luke xvii. 21.   (2) John xiv. 23.   (3) Hebrews xiii. 14.</p>

<h4 id="id00248" class="calibre12">CHAPTER II</h4>

<p id="id00249" class="calibre1">Of lowly submission</p>

<p id="id00250" class="calibre1">Make no great account who is for thee or against thee, but mind
only the present duty and take care that God be with thee in
whatsoever thou doest.  Have a good conscience and God will defend
thee, for he whom God will help no man's perverseness shall be
able to hurt.  If thou knowest how to hold thy peace and to
suffer, without doubt thou shalt see the help of the Lord.  He
knoweth the time and the way to deliver thee, therefore must thou
resign thyself to Him.  To God it belongeth to help and to
deliver from all confusion.  Oftentimes it is very profitable for
keeping us in greater humility, that others know and rebuke our
faults.</p>

<p id="id00251" class="calibre1">2. When a man humbleth himself for his defects, he then easily
pacifieth others and quickly satisfieth those that are angered
against him.  God protecteth and delivereth the humble man, He
loveth and comforteth the humble man, to the humble man He
inclineth Himself, on the humble He bestoweth great grace, and
when he is cast down He raiseth him to glory: to the humble He
revealeth His secrets, and sweetly draweth and inviteth him to
Himself.  The humble man having received reproach, is yet in
sufficient peace, because he resteth on God and not on the world.
Reckon not thyself to have profited in anywise unless thou feel
thyself to be inferior to all.</p>

<h4 id="id00252" class="calibre12">CHAPTER III</h4>

<p id="id00253" class="calibre1">Of the good, peaceable man</p>

<p id="id00254" class="calibre1">First keep thyself in peace, and then shalt thou be able to be a
peacemaker towards others.  A peaceable man doth more good than a
well-learned.  A passionate man turneth even good into evil and
easily believeth evil; a good, peaceable man converteth all
things into good.  He who dwelleth in peace is suspicious of
none, but he who is discontented and restless is tossed with many
suspicions, and is neither quiet himself nor suffereth others to
be quiet.  He often saith what he ought not to say, and omitteth
what it were more expedient for him to do.  He considereth to
what duties others are bound, and neglecteth those to which he is
bound himself.  Therefore be zealous first over thyself, and then
mayest thou righteously be zealous concerning thy neighbour.</p>

<p id="id00255" class="calibre1">2. Thou knowest well how to excuse and to colour thine own deeds,
but thou wilt not accept the excuses of others.  It would be more
just to accuse thyself and excuse thy brother.  If thou wilt that
others bear with thee, bear thou with others.  Behold how far
thou art as yet from the true charity and humility which knows
not how to be angry or indignant against any save self alone.
It is no great thing to mingle with the good and the meek, for
this is naturally pleasing to all, and every one of us willingly
enjoyeth peace and liketh best those who think with us: but to
be able to live peaceably with the hard and perverse, or with the
disorderly, or those who oppose us, this is a great grace and a
thing much to be commended and most worthy of a man.</p>

<p id="id00256" class="calibre1">3. There are who keep themselves in peace and keep peace also
with others, and there are who neither have peace nor suffer
others to have peace; they are troublesome to others, but always
more troublesome to themselves.  And there are who hold
themselves in peace, and study to bring others unto peace;
nevertheless, all our peace in this sad life lieth in humble
suffering rather than in not feeling adversities.  He who best
knoweth how to suffer shall possess the most peace; that man is
conqueror of himself and lord of the world, the friend of Christ,
and the inheritor of heaven.</p>

<h5 id="id00257" class="calibre4">CHAPTER IV</h5>

<p id="id00258" class="calibre1">Of a pure mind and simple intention</p>

<p id="id00259" class="calibre1">By two wings is man lifted above earthly things, even by
simplicity and purity.  Simplicity ought to be in the intention,
purity in the affection.  Simplicity reacheth towards God, purity
apprehendeth Him and tasteth Him.  No good action will be
distasteful to thee if thou be free within from inordinate
affection.  If thou reachest after and seekest, nothing but the
will of God and the benefit of thy neighbour, thou wilt entirely
enjoy inward liberty.  If thine heart were right, then should
every creature be a mirror of life and a book of holy doctrine.
There is no creature so small and vile but that it showeth us the
goodness of God.</p>

<p id="id00260" class="calibre1">2. If thou wert good and pure within, then wouldst thou look upon
all things without hurt and understand them aright.  A pure heart
seeth the very depths of heaven and hell.  Such as each one is
inwardly, so judgeth he outwardly.  If there is any joy in the
world surely the man of pure heart possesseth it, and if there is
anywhere tribulation and anguish, the evil conscience knoweth it
best.  As iron cast into the fire loseth rust and is made
altogether glowing, so the man who turneth himself altogether
unto God is freed from slothfulness and changed into a new man.</p>

<p id="id00261" class="calibre1">3. When a man beginneth to grow lukewarm, then he feareth a
little labour, and willingly accepteth outward consolation; but
when he beginneth perfectly to conquer himself and to walk
manfully in the way of God, then he counteth as nothing those
things which aforetime seemed to be so grievous unto him.</p>

<h4 id="id00262" class="calibre12">CHAPTER V</h4>

<p id="id00263" class="calibre1">Of self-esteem</p>

<p id="id00264" class="calibre1">We cannot place too little confidence in ourselves, because grace
and understanding are often lacking to us.  Little light is there
within us, and what we have we quickly lose by negligence.
Oftentimes we perceive not how great is our inward blindness.  We
often do ill and excuse it worse.  Sometimes we are moved by
passion and count it zeal; we blame little faults in others and
pass over great faults in ourselves.  Quickly enough we feel and
reckon up what we bear at the hands of others, but we reflect not
how much others are bearing from us.  He who would weigh well and
rightly his own doings would not be the man to judge severely of
another.</p>

<p id="id00265" class="calibre1">2. The spiritually-minded man putteth care of himself before all
cares; and he who diligently attendeth to himself easily keepeth
silence concerning others.  Thou wilt never be spiritually minded
and godly unless thou art silent concerning other men's matters
and take full heed to thyself.  If thou think wholly upon thyself
and upon God, what thou seest out of doors shall move thee
little.  Where art thou when thou art not present to thyself? and
when thou hast overrun all things, what hath it profited thee,
thyself being neglected?  If thou wouldst have peace and true
unity, thou must put aside all other things, and gaze only upon
thyself.</p>

<p id="id00266" class="calibre1">3. Then thou shalt make great progress if thou keep thyself free
from all temporal care.  Thou shalt lamentably fall away if thou
set a value upon any worldly thing.  Let nothing be great,
nothing high, nothing pleasing, nothing acceptable unto thee,
save God Himself or the things of God.  Reckon as altogether vain
whatsoever consolation comes to thee from a creature.  The soul
that loveth God looketh not to anything that is beneath God.  God
alone is eternal and incomprehensible, filling all things, the
solace of the soul, and the true joy of the heart.</p>

<h4 id="id00267" class="calibre12">CHAPTER VI</h4>

<p id="id00268" class="calibre1">Of the joy of a good conscience</p>

<p id="id00269" class="calibre1">The testimony of a good conscience is the glory of a good man.
Have a good conscience and thou shalt ever have joy.  A good
conscience is able to bear exceeding much, and is exceeding
joyful in the midst of adversities; an evil conscience is ever
fearful and unquiet.  Thou shalt rest sweetly if thy heart
condemn thee not.  Never rejoice unless when thou hast done well.
The wicked have never true joy, nor feel internal peace, for
there is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.(1)  And if they
say "we are in peace, there shall no harm happen unto us, and who
shall dare to do us hurt?" believe them not, for suddenly shall
the wrath of God rise up against them, and their deeds shall be
brought to nought, and their thoughts shall perish.</p>

<p id="id00270" class="calibre1">2. To glory in tribulation is not grievous to him who loveth; for
such glorying is glorying in the Cross of Christ.  Brief is the
glory which is given and received of men.  Sadness always goeth
hand in hand with the glory of the world.  The glory of the good
is in their conscience, and not in the report of men.  The joy of
the upright is from God and in God, and their joy is in the
truth.  He who desireth true and eternal glory careth not for
that which is temporal; and he who seeketh temporal glory, or who
despiseth it from his heart, is proved to bear little love for
that which is heavenly.  He who careth for neither praises nor
reproaches hath great tranquillity of heart.</p>

<p id="id00271" class="calibre1">3. He will easily be contented and filled with peace, whose
conscience is pure.  Thou art none the holier if thou art
praised, nor the viler if thou art reproached.  Thou art what
thou art; and thou canst not be better than God pronounceth thee
to be.  If thou considerest well what thou art inwardly, thou
wilt not care what men will say to thee.  Man looketh on the
outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart:(2) man
looketh on the deed, but God considereth the intent.  It is the
token of a humble spirit always to do well, and to set little by
oneself.  Not to look for consolation from any created thing is a
sign of great purity and inward faithfulness.</p>

<p id="id00272" class="calibre1">4. He that seeketh no outward witness on his own behalf, showeth
plainly that he hath committed himself wholly to God.  For not he
that commendeth himself is approved, as St. Paul saith, but whom
the Lord commendeth.(3)  To walk inwardly with God, and not to be
held by any outer affections, is the state of a spiritual man.</p>

<h4 id="id00274" class="calibre12">CHAPTER VII</h4>

<p id="id00275" class="calibre1">Of loving Jesus above all things</p>

<p id="id00276" class="calibre1">Blessed is he who understandeth what it is to love Jesus, and to
despise himself for Jesus' sake.  He must give up all that he
loveth for his Beloved, for Jesus will be loved alone above all
things.  The love of created things is deceiving and unstable,
but the love of Jesus is faithful and lasting.  He who cleaveth
to created things will fall with their slipperiness; but he who
embraceth Jesus will stand upright for ever.  Love Him and hold
Him for thy friend, for He will not forsake thee when all depart
from thee, nor will he suffer thee to perish at the last.  Thou
must one day be separated from all, whether thou wilt or wilt
not.</p>

<p id="id00277" class="calibre1">2. Cleave thou to Jesus in life and death, and commit thyself
unto His faithfulness, who, when all men fail thee, is alone able
to help thee.  Thy Beloved is such, by nature, that He will
suffer no rival, but alone will possess thy heart, and as a king
will sit upon His own throne.  If thou wouldst learn to put away
from thee every created thing, Jesus would freely take up His
abode with thee.  Thou wilt find all trust little better than
lost which thou hast placed in men, and not in Jesus.  Trust not
nor lean upon a reed shaken with the wind, because all flesh is
grass, and the goodliness thereof falleth as the flower of the
field.(1)</p>

<p id="id00278" class="calibre1">3. Thou wilt be quickly deceived if thou lookest only upon the
outward appearance of men, for if thou seekest thy comfort and
profit in others, thou shalt too often experience loss.  If thou
seekest Jesus in all things thou shalt verily find Jesus, but if
thou seekest thyself thou shalt also find thyself, but to thine
own hurt.  For if a man seeketh not Jesus he is more hurtful to
himself than all the world and all his adversaries.</p>

<p id="id00279" class="calibre1">(1) Isaiah xl. 6.</p>

<h4 id="id00280" class="calibre12">CHAPTER VIII</h4>

<p id="id00281" class="calibre1">Of the intimate love of Jesus</p>

<p id="id00282" class="calibre1">When Jesus is present all is well and nothing seemeth hard, but
when Jesus is not present everything is hard.  When Jesus
speaketh not within, our comfort is nothing worth, but if Jesus
speaketh but a single word great is the comfort we experience.
Did not Mary Magdalene rise up quickly from the place where she
wept when Martha said to her, The Master is come and calleth for
thee?(1)  Happy hour when Jesus calleth thee from tears to the
joy of the spirit!  How dry and hard art thou without Jesus!  How
senseless and vain if thou desirest aught beyond Jesus!  Is not
this greater loss than if thou shouldst lose the whole world?</p>

<p id="id00283" class="calibre1">2. What can the world profit thee without Jesus?  To be without
Jesus is the nethermost hell, and to be with Jesus is sweet
paradise.  If Jesus were with thee no enemy could hurt thee.  He
who findeth Jesus findeth a good treasure, yea, good above all
good; and he who loseth Jesus loseth exceeding much, yea, more
than the whole world.  Most poor is he who liveth without Jesus,
and most rich is he who is much with Jesus.</p>

<p id="id00284" class="calibre1">3. It is great skill to know how to live with Jesus, and to know
how to hold Jesus is great wisdom.  Be thou humble and peaceable
and Jesus shall be with thee.  Be godly and quiet, and Jesus will
remain with thee.  Thou canst quickly drive away Jesus and lose
His favour if thou wilt turn away to the outer things.  And if
thou hast put Him to flight and lost Him, to whom wilt thou flee,
and whom then wilt thou seek for a friend?  Without a friend thou
canst not live long, and if Jesus be not thy friend above all
thou shalt be very sad and desolate.  Madly therefore doest thou
if thou trusteth or findest joy in any other.  It is preferable
to have the whole world against thee, than Jesus offended with
thee.  Therefore of all that are dear to thee, let Jesus be
specially loved.</p>

<p id="id00285" class="calibre1">4. Let all be loved for Jesus' sake, but Jesus for His own.
Jesus Christ alone is to be specially loved, for He alone is
found good and faithful above all friends.  For His sake and in
Him let both enemies and friends be dear to thee, and pray for
them all that they may all know and love Him.  Never desire to be
specially praised or loved, because this belongeth to God alone,
who hath none like unto Himself.  Nor wish thou that any one set
his heart on thee, nor do thou give thyself up to the love of
any, but let Jesus be in thee and in every good man.</p>

<p id="id00286" class="calibre1">5. Be pure and free within thyself, and be not entangled by any
created thing.  Thou oughtest to bring a bare and clean heart to
God, if thou desirest to be ready to see how gracious the Lord
is.  And in truth, unless thou be prevented and drawn on by His
grace, thou wilt not attain to this, that having cast out and
dismissed all else, thou alone art united to God.  For when the
grace of God cometh to a man, then he becometh able to do all
things, and when it departeth then he will be poor and weak and
given up unto troubles.  In these thou art not to be cast down
nor to despair, but to rest with calm mind on the will of God,
and to bear all things which come upon thee unto the praise of
Jesus Christ; for after winter cometh summer, after night
returneth day, after the tempest a great calm.</p>

<p id="id00287" class="calibre1">(1) John xi. 28.</p>

<h4 id="id00288" class="calibre12">CHAPTER IX</h4>

<p id="id00289" class="calibre1">Of the lack of all comfort</p>

<p id="id00290" class="calibre1">It is no hard thing to despise human comfort when divine is
present.  It is a great thing, yea very great, to be able to bear
the loss both of human and divine comfort; and for the love of
God willingly to bear exile of heart, and in nought to seek
oneself, nor to look to one's own merit.  What great matter is
it, if thou be cheerful of heart and devout when favour cometh to
thee?  That is an hour wherein all rejoice.  Pleasantly enough
doth he ride whom the grace of God carrieth.  And what marvel, if
he feeleth no burden who is carried by the Almighty, and is led
onwards by the Guide from on high?</p>

<p id="id00291" class="calibre1">2. We are willing to accept anything for comfort, and it is
difficult for a man to be freed from himself.  The holy martyr
Laurence overcame the love of the world and even of his priestly
master, because he despised everything in the world which seemed
to be pleasant; and for the love of Christ he calmly suffered
even God's chief priest, Sixtus, whom he dearly loved, to be
taken from him.  Thus by the love of the Creator he overcame the
love of man, and instead of human comfort he chose rather God's
good pleasure.  So also learn thou to resign any near and beloved
friend for the love of God.  Nor take it amiss when thou hast
been deserted by a friend, knowing that we must all be parted
from one another at last.</p>

<p id="id00292" class="calibre1">3. Mightily and long must a man strive within himself before he
learn altogether to overcome himself, and to draw his whole
affection towards God.  When a man resteth upon himself, he
easily slippeth away unto human comforts.  But a true lover of
Christ, and a diligent seeker after virtue, falleth not back upon
those comforts, nor seeketh such sweetness as may be tasted and
handled, but desireth rather hard exercises, and to undertake
severe labours for Christ.</p>

<p id="id00293" class="calibre1">4. When, therefore, spiritual comfort is given by God, receive it
with giving of thanks, and know that it is the gift of God, not
thy desert.  Be not lifted up, rejoice not overmuch nor foolishly
presume, but rather be more humble for the gift, more wary and
more careful in all thy doings; for that hour will pass away, and
temptation will follow.  When comfort is taken from thee, do not
straightway despair, but wait for the heavenly visitation with
humility and patience, for God is able to give thee back greater
favour and consolation.  This is not new nor strange to those who
have made trial of the way of God, for with the great saints and
the ancient prophets there was often this manner of change.</p>

<p id="id00294" class="calibre1">5. Wherefore one said when the favour of God was present with
him, I said in my prosperity I shall never be moved,(1) but he
goeth on to say what he felt within himself when the favour
departed: Thou didst turn Thy face from me, and I was troubled.
In spite whereof he in no wise despaireth, but the more instantly
entreateth God, and saith, Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, and
will pray unto my God; and then he receiveth the fruit of his
prayer, and testifieth how he hath been heard, saying, The Lord
heard me and had mercy upon me, the Lord was my helper.  But
wherein?  Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy, Thou hast put
off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness.  If it was thus
with the great saints, we who are poor and needy ought not to
despair if we are sometimes in the warmth and sometimes in the
cold, for the Spirit cometh and goeth according to the good
pleasure of His will.  Wherefore holy Job saith, Thou dost visit
him in the morning, and suddenly Thou dost prove him.(2)</p>

<p id="id00295" class="calibre1">6. Whereupon then can I hope, or wherein may I trust, save only
in the great mercy of God, and the hope of heavenly grace?  For
whether good men are with me, godly brethren or faithful friends,
whether holy books or beautiful discourses, whether sweet hymns
and songs, all these help but little, and have but little savour
when I am deserted by God's favour and left to mine own poverty.
There is no better remedy, then, than patience and denial of
self, and an abiding in the will of God.</p>

<p id="id00296" class="calibre1">7. I have never found any man so religious and godly, but that he
felt sometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour, and lack of
fervour.  No saint was ever so filled with rapture, so
enlightened, but that sooner or later he was tempted.  For he is
not worthy of the great vision of God, who, for God's sake, hath
not been exercised by some temptation.  For temptation is wont
to go before as a sign of the comfort which shall follow, and
heavenly comfort is promised to those who are proved by
temptation.  As it is written, To him that overcometh I will
give to eat of the tree of life.(3)</p>

<p id="id00297" class="calibre1">8. Divine comfort is given that a man may be stronger to bear
adversities.  And temptation followeth, lest he be lifted up
because of the benefit.  The devil sleepeth not; thy flesh is not
yet dead; therefore, cease thou not to make thyself ready unto
the battle, for enemies stand on thy right hand and on thy left,
and they are never at rest.</p>

<h4 id="id00299" class="calibre12">CHAPTER X</h4>

<p id="id00300" class="calibre1">Of gratitude for the Grace of God</p>

<p id="id00301" class="calibre1">Why seekest thou rest when thou art born to labour?  Prepare
thyself for patience more than for comforts, and for bearing the
cross more than for joy.  For who among the men of this world
would not gladly receive consolation and spiritual joy if he
might always have it?  For spiritual comforts exceed all the
delights of the world, and all the pleasures of the flesh.  For
all worldly delights are either empty or unclean, whilst
spiritual delights alone are pleasant and honourable, the
offspring of virtue, and poured forth by God into pure minds.
But no man can always enjoy these divine comforts at his own
will, because the season of temptation ceaseth not for long.</p>

<p id="id00302" class="calibre1">2. Great is the difference between a visitation from above and
false liberty of spirit and great confidence in self.  God doeth
well in giving us the grace of comfort, but man doeth ill in not
immediately giving God thanks thereof.  And thus the gifts of
grace are not able to flow unto us, because we are ungrateful to
the Author of them, and return them not wholly to the Fountain
whence they flow.  For grace ever becometh the portion of him who
is grateful and that is taken away from the proud, which is wont
to be given to the humble.</p>

<p id="id00303" class="calibre1">3. I desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction,
I love no contemplation which leadeth to pride.  For all that is
high is not holy, nor is everything that is sweet good; every
desire is not pure; nor is everything that is dear to us pleasing
unto God.  Willingly do I accept that grace whereby I am made
humbler and more wary and more ready to renounce myself.  He who
is made learned by the gift of grace and taught wisdom by the
stroke of the withdrawal thereof, will not dare to claim any good
thing for himself, but will rather confess that he is poor and
needy.  Give unto God the thing which is God's,(1) and ascribe to
thyself that which is thine; that is, give thanks unto God for
His grace, but for thyself alone confess thy fault, and that thy
punishment is deserved for thy fault.</p>

<p id="id00304" class="calibre1">4. Sit thou down always in the lowest room and thou shalt be
given the highest place.(2)  For the highest cannot be without
the lowest.  For the highest saints of God are least in their own
sight, and the more glorious they are, so much the lowlier are
they in themselves; full of grace and heavenly glory, they are
not desirous of vain-glory; resting on God and strong in His
might, they cannot be lifted up in any wise.  And they who
ascribe unto God all the good which they have received, "seek not
glory one of another, but the glory which cometh from God only,"
and they desire that God shall be praised in Himself and in all
His Saints above all things, and they are always striving for
this very thing.</p>

<p id="id00305" class="calibre1">5. Be thankful, therefore, for the least benefit and thou shalt
be worthy to receive greater.  Let the least be unto thee even as
the greatest, and let that which is of little account be unto
thee as a special gift.  If the majesty of the Giver be
considered, nothing that is given shall seem small and of no
worth, for that is not a small thing which is given by the Most
High God.  Yea, though He gave punishment and stripes, we ought
to be thankful, because He ever doth for our profit whatever He
suffereth to come upon us.  He who seeketh to retain the favour
of God, let him be thankful for the favour which is given, and
patient in respect of that which is taken away.  Let him pray
that it may return; let him be wary and humble that he lose it
not.</p>

<h4 id="id00307" class="calibre12">CHAPTER XI</h4>

<p id="id00308" class="calibre1">Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus</p>

<p id="id00309" class="calibre1">Jesus hath many lovers of His heavenly kingdom, but few bearers of
His Cross.  He hath many seekers of comfort, but few of
tribulation.  He findeth many companions of His table, but few of
His fasting.  All desire to rejoice with Him, few are willing to
undergo anything for His sake.  Many follow Jesus that they may
eat of His loaves, but few that they may drink of the cup of His
passion.  Many are astonished at His Miracles, few follow after
the shame of His Cross.  Many love Jesus so long as no
adversities happen to them.  Many praise Him and bless Him, so
long as they receive any comforts from Him.  But if Jesus hide
Himself and withdraw from them a little while, they fall either
into complaining or into too great dejection of mind.</p>

<p id="id00310" class="calibre1">2. But they who love Jesus for Jesus' sake, and not for any
consolation of their own, bless Him in all tribulation and
anguish of heart as in the highest consolation.  And if He should
never give them consolation, nevertheless they would always
praise Him and always give Him thanks.</p>

<p id="id00311" class="calibre1">3. Oh what power hath the pure love of Jesus, unmixed with any
gain or love of self!  Should not all they be called mercenary
who are always seeking consolations?  Do they not prove
themselves lovers of self more than of Christ who are always
seeking their own gain and advantage?  Where shall be found one
who is willing to serve God altogether for nought?</p>

<p id="id00312" class="calibre1">4. Rarely is any one found so spiritual as to be stripped of all
selfish thoughts, for who shall find a man truly poor in spirit
and free of all created things?  "His value is from afar, yea
from the ends of the earth."  A man may give away all his goods,
yet that is nothing; and if he do many deeds of penitence, yet
that is a small thing; and though he understand all knowledge,
yet that is afar off; and if he have great virtue and zealous
devotion, yet much is lacking unto him, yea, one thing which is
the most necessary to him of all.  What is it then?  That having
given up all things besides, he give up himself and go forth from
himself utterly, and retain nothing of self-love; and having done
all things which he knoweth to be his duty to do, that he feel
that he hath done nothing.  Let him not reckon that much which
might be much esteemed, but let him pronounce himself to be in
truth an unprofitable servant, as the Truth Himself saith, When
ye have done all things that are commanded you, say, we are
unprofitable servants.(1)  Then may he be truly poor and naked in
spirit, and be able to say with the Prophet, As for me, I am poor
and needy.(2)  Nevertheless, no man is richer than he, no man
stronger, no man freer.  For he knoweth both how to give up
himself and all things, and how to be lowly in his own eyes.</p>

<h4 id="id00314" class="calibre12">CHAPTER XII</h4>

<p id="id00315" class="calibre1">Of the royal way of the Holy Cross</p>

<p id="id00316" class="calibre1">That seemeth a hard saying to many, If any man will come after
Me, let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow Me.(1)
But it will be much harder to hear that last sentence, Depart
from me, ye wicked, into eternal fire.(2)  For they who now
willingly hear the word of the Cross and follow it, shall not
then fear the hearing of eternal damnation.  This sign of the
Cross shall be in heaven when the Lord cometh to Judgment.  Then
all servants of the Cross, who in life have conformed themselves
to the Crucified, shall draw nigh unto Christ the Judge with
great boldness.</p>

<p id="id00317" class="calibre1">2. Why fearest thou then to take up the cross which leadeth to a
kingdom?  In the Cross is health, in the Cross is life, in the
Cross is protection from enemies, in the Cross is heavenly
sweetness, in the Cross strength of mind, in the Cross joy of
the spirit, in the Cross the height of virtue, in the Cross
perfection of holiness.  There is no health of the soul, no hope
of eternal life, save in the Cross.  Take up therefore, thy cross
and follow Jesus and thou shalt go into eternal life.  He went
before thee bearing His Cross and died for thee upon the Cross,
that thou also mayest bear thy cross and mayest love to be
crucified upon it.  For if thou be dead with Him, thou shalt also
live with Him, and if thou be a partaker of His sufferings thou
shalt be also of His glory.</p>

<p id="id00318" class="calibre1">3. Behold everything dependeth upon the Cross, and everything
lieth in dying; and there is none other way unto life and to true
inward peace, except the way of the Holy Cross and of daily
mortification.  Go where thou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt,
and thou shalt find no higher way above nor safer way below, than
the way of the Holy Cross.  Dispose and order all things
according to thine own will and judgment, and thou shalt ever
find something to suffer either willingly or unwillingly, and
thus thou shalt ever find thy cross.  For thou shalt either feel
pain of body, or tribulation of spirit within thy soul.</p>

<p id="id00319" class="calibre1">4. Sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of God, sometimes thou wilt be
tried by thy neighbour, and which is more, thou wilt often be
wearisome to thyself.  And still thou canst not be delivered nor
eased by any remedy or consolation, but must bear so long as God
will.  For God will have thee learn to suffer tribulation without
consolation, and to submit thyself fully to it, and by
tribulation be made more humble.  No man understandeth the
Passion of Christ in his heart so well as he who hath had
somewhat of the like suffering himself.  The Cross therefore is
always ready, and every where waiteth for thee.  Thou canst not
flee from it whithersoever thou hurriest, for whithersoever thou
comest, thou bearest thyself with thee, and shalt ever find
thyself.  Turn thee above, turn thee below, turn thee without,
turn thee within, and in them all thou shalt find the Cross; and
needful is it that thou everywhere possess patience if thou wilt
have internal peace and gain the everlasting crown.</p>

<p id="id00320" class="calibre1">5. If thou willingly bear the Cross, it will bear thee, and will
bring thee to the end which thou seekest, even where there shall
be the end of suffering; though it shall not be here.  If thou
bear it unwillingly, thou makest a burden for thyself and greatly
increaseth thy load, and yet thou must bear it.  If thou cast
away one cross, without doubt thou shalt find another and
perchance a heavier.</p>

<p id="id00321" class="calibre1">6. Thinketh thou to escape what no mortal hath been able to
avoid?  Which of the saints in the world hath been without the
cross and tribulation?  For not even Jesus Christ our Lord was
one hour without the anguish of His Passion, so long as He lived.
It behooved, He said, Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead,
and so enter into his glory.(3)  And how dost thou seek another
way than this royal way, which is the way of the Holy Cross?</p>

<p id="id00322" class="calibre1">7. The whole life of Christ was a cross and martyrdom, and dost
thou seek for thyself rest and joy?  Thou art wrong, thou art
wrong, if thou seekest aught but to suffer tribulations, for this
whole mortal life is full of miseries, and set round with
crosses.  And the higher a man hath advanced in the spirit, the
heavier crosses he will often find, because the sorrow of his
banishment increaseth with the strength of his love.</p>

<p id="id00323" class="calibre1">8. But yet the man who is thus in so many wise afflicted, is not
without refreshment of consolation, because he feeleth abundant
fruit to be growing within him out of the bearing of his cross.
For whilst he willingly submitteth himself to it, every burden of
tribulation is turned into an assurance of divine comfort, and
the more the flesh is wasted by affliction, the more is the
spirit strengthened mightily by inward grace.  And ofttimes so
greatly is he comforted by the desire for tribulation and
adversity, through love of conformity to the Cross of Christ,
that he would not be without sorrow and tribulation; for he
believeth that he shall be the more acceptable to God, the more
and the heavier burdens he is able to bear for His sake.  This is
not the virtue of man, but the grace of Christ which hath such
power and energy in the weak flesh, that what it naturally hateth
and fleeth from, this it draweth to and loveth through fervour of
spirit.</p>

<p id="id00324" class="calibre1">9. It is not in the nature of man to bear the cross, to love the
cross, to keep under the body and to bring it into subjection, to
fly from honours, to bear reproaches meekly, to despise self and
desire to be despised, to bear all adversities and losses, and to
desire no prosperity in this world.  If thou lookest to thyself,
thou wilt of thyself be able to do none of this; but if thou
trustest in the Lord, endurance shall be given thee from heaven,
and the world and the flesh shall be made subject to thy command.
Yea, thou shalt not even fear thine adversary the devil, if thou
be armed with faith and signed with the Cross of Christ.</p>

<p id="id00325" class="calibre1">10. Set thyself, therefore, like a good and faithful servant of
Christ, to the manful bearing of the Cross of thy Lord, who out
of love was crucified for thee.  Prepare thyself for the bearing
many adversities and manifold troubles in this wretched life;
because so it shall be with thee wheresoever thou art, and so in
very deed thou shalt find it, wherever thou hide thyself.  This
it must be; and there is no means of escaping from tribulation
and sorrow, except to bear them patiently.  Drink thou lovingly
thy Lord's cup if thou desirest to be His friend and to have thy
lot with Him.  Leave consolations to God, let Him do as seemeth
best to Him concerning them.  But do thou set thyself to endure
tribulations, and reckon them the best consolations; for the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which shall be revealed in us,(4) nor would they
be even if thou wert to endure them all.</p>

<p id="id00326" class="calibre1">11. When thou hast come to this, that tribulation is sweet and
pleasant to thee for Christ's sake, then reckon that it is well
with thee, because thou hast found paradise on earth.  So long as
it is hard to thee to suffer and thou desirest to escape, so long
it will not be well with thee, and tribulations will follow thee
everywhere.</p>

<p id="id00327" class="calibre1">12. If thou settest thyself to that thou oughtest, namely, to
suffer and to die, it shall soon go better with thee, and thou
shalt find peace.  Though thou shouldest be caught up with Paul
unto the third heaven,(5) thou art not on that account secure
from suffering evil.  I will show him, saith Jesus, what great
things he must suffer for My Name's sake.(6)  It remaineth,
therefore, to thee to suffer, if thou wilt love Jesus and serve
Him continually.</p>

<p id="id00328" class="calibre1">13. Oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of
Jesus, how great glory should await thee, what rejoicing among
all the saints of God, what bright example also to thy neighbour!
For all men commend patience, although few be willing to practise
it.  Thou oughtest surely to suffer a little for Christ when many
suffer heavier things for the world.</p>

<p id="id00329" class="calibre1">14. Know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of
a dying man.  And the more a man dieth to himself, the more he
beginneth to live towards God.  None is fit for the understanding
of heavenly things, unless he hath submitted himself to bearing
adversities for Christ.  Nothing more acceptable to God, nothing
more healthful for thyself in this world, than to suffer
willingly for Christ.  And if it were thine to choose, thou
oughtest rather to wish to suffer adversities for Christ, than to
be refreshed with manifold consolations, for thou wouldest be
more like Christ and more conformed to all saints.  For our
worthiness and growth in grace lieth not in many delights and
consolations, but rather in bearing many troubles and
adversities.</p>

<p id="id00330" class="calibre1">15. If indeed there had been anything better and more profitable
to the health of men than to suffer, Christ would surely have
shown it by word and example.  For both the disciples who
followed Him, and all who desire to follow Him, He plainly
exhorteth to bear their cross, and saith, If any man will come
after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow
Me.(7)  So now that we have thoroughly read and studied all
things, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.  We must
through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.(8)</p>

<h3 id="id00333" class="calibre11">ON INWARD CONSOLATION</h3>

<h5 id="id00334" class="calibre4">CHAPTER I</h5>

<p id="id00335" class="calibre1">Of the inward voice of Christ to the faithful soul</p>

<p id="id00336" class="calibre1">I will hearken what the Lord God shall say within me.(1)  Blessed
is the soul which heareth the Lord speaking within it, and
receiveth the word of consolation from His mouth.  Blessed are
the ears which receive the echoes of the soft whisper of God, and
turn not aside to the whisperings of this world.  Blessed truly
are the ears which listen not to the voice that soundeth without,
but to that which teacheth truth inwardly.  Blessed are the eyes
which are closed to things without, but are fixed upon things
within.  Blessed are they who search inward things and study to
prepare themselves more and more by daily exercises for the
receiving of heavenly mysteries.  Blessed are they who long to
have leisure for God, and free themselves from every hindrance of
the world.  Think on these things, O my soul, and shut the doors
of thy carnal desires, so mayest thou hear what the Lord God will
say within thee.</p>

<p id="id00337" class="calibre1">2. These things saith thy Beloved, "I am thy salvation, I am thy
peace and thy life.  Keep thee unto Me, and thou shalt find
peace."  Put away thee all transitory things, seek those things
that are eternal.  For what are all temporal things but deceits,
and what shall all created things help thee if thou be forsaken
by the Creator?  Therefore put all things else away, and give
thyself to the Creator, to be well pleasing and faithful to Him,
that thou mayest be able to attain true blessedness.</p>

<p id="id00338" class="calibre1">(1) Psalm lxxxv. 8.</p>

<h4 id="id00339" class="calibre12">CHAPTER II</h4>

<p id="id00340" class="calibre1">What the truth saith inwardly without noise of words</p>

<p id="id00341" class="calibre1">Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth.(1)  I am Thy servant; O give
me understanding that I may know Thy testimonies.  Incline my
heart unto the words of Thy mouth.(2)  Let thy speech distil as
the dew.  The children of Israel spake in old time to Moses,
Speak thou unto us and we will hear, but let not the Lord speak
unto us lest we die.(3)  Not thus, O Lord, not thus do I pray,
but rather with Samuel the prophet, I beseech Thee humbly and
earnestly, Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.  Let not Moses
speak to me, nor any prophet, but rather speak Thou, O Lord, who
didst inspire and illuminate all the prophets; for Thou alone
without them canst perfectly fill me with knowledge, whilst they
without Thee shall profit nothing.</p>

<p id="id00342" class="calibre1">2. They can indeed utter words, but they give not the spirit.
They speak with exceeding beauty, but when Thou art silent they
kindle not the heart.  They give us scriptures, but Thou makest
known the sense thereof.  They bring us mysteries, but Thou
revealest the things which are signified.  They utter
commandments, but Thou helpest to the fulfilling of them.  They
show the way, but Thou givest strength for the journey.  They act
only outwardly, but Thou dost instruct and enlighten the heart.
They water, but Thou givest the increase.  They cry with words,
but Thou givest understanding to the hearer.</p>

<p id="id00343" class="calibre1">3. Therefore let not Moses speak to me, but Thou, O Lord my God,
Eternal Truth; lest I die and bring forth no fruit, being
outwardly admonished, but not enkindled within; lest the word
heard but not followed, known but not loved, believed but not
obeyed, rise up against me in the judgment.  Speak, Lord, for Thy
servant heareth; Thou hast the words of eternal life.(4)  Speak
unto me for some consolation unto my soul, for the amendment of
my whole life, and for the praise and glory and eternal honour of
Thy Name.</p>

<p id="id00344" class="calibre1">(1) 1 Samuel iii. 9.   (2) Psalm cxix. 125.   (3) Exodus xx. 19.
(4) John vi. 68.</p>

<h4 id="id00345" class="calibre12">CHAPTER III</h4>

<p id="id00346" class="calibre1">How all the words of God are to be heard with humility, and how
many consider them not</p>

<p id="id00347" class="calibre1">"My Son, hear My words, for My words are most sweet, surpassing
all the knowledge of the philosophers and wise men of this world.
My words are spirit, and they are life,(1) and are not to be
weighed by man's understanding.  They are not to be drawn forth
for vain approbation, but to be heard in silence, and to be
received with all humility and with deep love."</p>

<p id="id00348" class="calibre1">2. And I said, "Blessed is the man whom Thou teachest, O Lord,
and instructest him in Thy law, that Thou mayest give him rest in
time of adversity,(2) and that he be not desolate in the earth."</p>

<p id="id00349" class="calibre1">3. "I," saith the Lord, "taught the prophets from the beginning,
and even now cease I not to speak unto all; but many are deaf and
hardened against My voice; many love to listen to the world
rather than to God, they follow after the desires of the flesh
more readily than after the good pleasure of God.  The world
promiseth things that are temporal and small, and it is served
with great eagerness.  I promise things that are great and
eternal, and the hearts of mortals are slow to stir.  Who serveth
and obeyeth Me in all things, with such carefulness as he serveth
the world and its rulers?</p>

<p id="id00350" class="calibre1">Â Â Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, saith the sea;(3)<br class="calibre3"/>

Â Â And if thou reason seekest, hear thou me.<br class="calibre3"/>
</p>

<p id="id00351" class="calibre1">For a little reward men make a long journey; for eternal life
many will scarce lift a foot once from the ground.  Mean reward
is sought after; for a single piece of money sometimes there is
shameful striving; for a thing which is vain and for a trifling
promise, men shrink not from toiling day and night."</p>

<p id="id00352" class="calibre1">4. "But, O shame! for an unchangeable good, for an inestimable
reward, for the highest honour and for a glory that fadeth not
away, it is irksome to them to toil even a little.  Be thou
ashamed therefore, slothful and discontented servant, for they
are found readier unto perdition than thou unto life.  They
rejoice more heartily in vanity than thou in the truth.
Sometimes, indeed, they are disappointed of their hope, but my
promise faileth no man, nor sendeth away empty him who trusteth
in Me.  What I have promised I will give; what I have said I will
fulfil; if only a man remain faithful in My love unto the end.
Therefore am I the rewarder of all good men, and a strong
approver of all who are godly.</p>

<p id="id00353" class="calibre1">5. "Write My words in thy heart and consider them diligently, for
they shall be very needful to thee in time of temptation.  What
thou understandest not when thou readest, thou shalt know in the
time of thy visitation.  I am wont to visit Mine elect in twofold
manner, even by temptation and by comfort, and I teach them two
lessons day by day, the one in chiding their faults, the other in
exhorting them to grow in grace.  He who hath My words and
rejecteth them, hath one who shall judge him at the last day."</p>

<h4 id="id00354" class="calibre12">A PRAYER FOR THE SPIRIT OF DEVOTION</h4>

<p id="id00355" class="calibre1">6. O Lord my God, Thou art all my good, and who am I that I
should dare to speak unto Thee?  I am the very poorest of Thy
servants, an abject worm, much poorer and more despicable than I
know or dare to say.  Nevertheless remember, O Lord, that I am
nothing, I have nothing, and can do nothing.  Thou only art good,
just and holy; Thou canst do all things, art over all things,
fillest all things, leaving empty only the sinner.  Call to mind
Thy tender mercies, and fill my heart with Thy grace, Thou who
wilt not that Thy work should return to Thee void.</p>

<p id="id00356" class="calibre1">7. How can I bear this miserable life unless Thy mercy and grace
strengthen me?  Turn not away Thy face from me, delay not Thy
visitation.  Withdraw not Thou Thy comfort from me, lest my soul
"gasp after thee as a thirsty land."  Lord, teach me to do Thy
will, teach me to walk humbly and uprightly before Thee, for Thou
art my wisdom, who knowest me in truth, and knewest me before the
world was made and before I was born into the world.</p>

<p id="id00357" class="calibre1">(1) John vi. 63.   (2) Psalm xciv. 13.   (3) Isaiah xxiii. 4.</p>

<h4 id="id00358" class="calibre12">CHAPTER IV</h4>

<p id="id00359" class="calibre1">How we must walk in truth and humility before God</p>

<p id="id00360" class="calibre1">"My Son! walk before Me in truth, and in the simplicity of thy
heart seek Me continually.  He who walketh before Me in the truth
shall be safe from evil assaults, and the truth shall deliver him
from the wiles and slanders of the wicked.  If the truth shall
make thee free, thou shalt be free indeed, and shalt not care for
the vain words of men."</p>

<p id="id00361" class="calibre1">2. Lord, it is true as Thou sayest; let it, I pray Thee, be so
with me; let Thy truth teach me, let it keep me and preserve me
safe unto the end.  Let it free me from all evil and inordinate
affection, and I will walk before Thee in great freedom of heart.</p>

<p id="id00362" class="calibre1">3. "I will teach thee," saith the Truth, "the things which are
right and pleasing before Me.  Think upon thy sins with great
displeasure and sorrow, and never think thyself anything because
of thy good works.  Verily thou art a sinner, liable to many
passions, yea, tied and bound with them.  Of thyself thou always
tendest unto nothing, thou wilt quickly fall, quickly be
conquered, quickly disturbed, quickly undone.  Thou hast nought
whereof to glory, but many reasons why thou shouldest reckon
thyself vile, for thou art far weaker than thou art able to
comprehend.</p>

<p id="id00363" class="calibre1">4. "Let, therefore, nothing which thou doest seem to thee great;
let nothing be grand, nothing of value or beauty, nothing worthy
of honour, nothing lofty, nothing praiseworthy or desirable,
save what is eternal.  Let the eternal truth please thee above
all things, let thine own great vileness displease thee
continually.  Fear, denounce, flee nothing so much as thine own
faults and sins, which ought to be more displeasing to thee than
any loss whatsoever of goods.  There are some who walk not
sincerely before me, but being led by curiosity and pride, they
desire to know my secret things and to understand the deep things
of God, whilst they neglect themselves and their salvation.
These often fall into great temptations and sins because of their
pride and curiosity, for I am against them.</p>

<p id="id00364" class="calibre1">5. "Fear thou the judgments of God, fear greatly the wrath of the
Almighty.  Shrink from debating upon the works of the Most High,
but search narrowly thine own iniquities into what great sins
thou hast fallen, and how many good things thou hast neglected.
There are some who carry their devotion only in books, some in
pictures, some in outward signs and figures; some have Me in
their mouths, but little in their hearts.  Others there are who,
being enlightened in their understanding and purged in their
affections, continually long after eternal things, hear of
earthly things with unwillingness, obey the necessities of nature
with sorrow.  And these understand what the Spirit of truth
speaketh in them; for He teacheth them to despise earthly things
and to love heavenly; to neglect the world and to desire heaven
all the day and night."</p>

<h4 id="id00365" class="calibre12">CHAPTER V</h4>

<p id="id00366" class="calibre1">Of the wonderful power of the Divine Love</p>

<p id="id00367" class="calibre1">I bless Thee, O Heavenly Father, Father of my Lord Jesus Christ,
for that Thou hast vouchsafed to think of me, poor that I am.  O,
Father of Mercies and God of all comfort,(1) I give thanks unto
Thee, who refreshest me sometimes with thine own comfort, when I
am unworthy of any comfort.  I bless and glorify Thee
continually, with thine only begotten Son and the Holy Ghost, the
Paraclete, for ever and ever.  O Lord God, Holy lover of my soul,
when Thou shalt come into my heart, all my inward parts shall
rejoice.  Thou art my glory and the joy of my heart.  Thou art my
hope and my refuge in the day of my trouble.</p>

<p id="id00368" class="calibre1">2. But because I am still weak in love and imperfect in virtue, I
need to be strengthened and comforted by Thee; therefore visit
Thou me often and instruct me with Thy holy ways of discipline.
Deliver me from evil passions, and cleanse my heart from all
inordinate affections, that, being healed and altogether cleansed
within, I may be made ready to love, strong to suffer, steadfast
to endure.</p>

<p id="id00369" class="calibre1">3. Love is a great thing, a good above all others, which alone
maketh every heavy burden light, and equaliseth every inequality.
For it beareth the burden and maketh it no burden, it maketh
every bitter thing to be sweet and of good taste.  The surpassing
love of Jesus impelleth to great works, and exciteth to the
continual desiring of greater perfection.  Love willeth to be
raised up, and not to be held down by any mean thing.  Love
willeth to be free and aloof from all worldly affection, lest its
inward power of vision be hindered, lest it be entangled by any
worldly prosperity or overcome by adversity.  Nothing is sweeter
than love, nothing stronger, nothing loftier, nothing broader,
nothing pleasanter, nothing fuller or better in heaven nor on
earth, for love was born of God and cannot rest save in God above
all created things.</p>

<p id="id00370" class="calibre1">4. He who loveth flyeth, runneth, and is glad; he is free and not
hindered.  He giveth all things for all things, and hath all
things in all things, because he resteth in One who is high above
all, from whom every good floweth and proceedeth.  He looketh not
for gifts, but turneth himself to the Giver above all good
things.  Love oftentimes knoweth no measure, but breaketh out
above all measure; love feeleth no burden, reckoneth not labours,
striveth after more than it is able to do, pleadeth not
impossibility, because it judgeth all things which are lawful for
it to be possible.  It is strong therefore for all things, and it
fulfilleth many things, and is successful where he who loveth not
faileth and lieth down.</p>

<p id="id00371" class="calibre1">5. Love is watchful, and whilst sleeping still keepeth watch;
though fatigued it is not weary, though pressed it is not forced,
though alarmed it is not terrified, but like the living flame and
the burning torch, it breaketh forth on high and securely
triumpheth.  If a man loveth, he knoweth what this voice crieth.
For the ardent affection of the soul is a great clamour in the
ears of God, and it saith: My God, my Beloved!  Thou art all
mine, and I am all Thine.</p>

<p id="id00372" class="calibre1">6. Enlarge Thou me in love, that I may learn to taste with the
innermost mouth of my heart how sweet it is to love, to be
dissolved, and to swim in love.  Let me be holden by love,
mounting above myself through exceeding fervour and admiration.
Let me sing the song of love, let me follow Thee my Beloved on
high, let my soul exhaust itself in Thy praise, exulting with
love.  Let me love Thee more than myself, not loving myself
except for Thy sake, and all men in Thee who truly love Thee, as
the law of love commandeth which shineth forth from Thee.</p>

<p id="id00373" class="calibre1">7. Love is swift, sincere, pious, pleasant, gentle, strong,
patient, faithful, prudent, long-suffering, manly, and never
seeking her own; for wheresoever a man seeketh his own, there he
falleth from love.  Love is circumspect, humble, and upright; not
weak, not fickle, nor intent on vain things; sober, chaste,
steadfast, quiet, and guarded in all the senses.  Love is subject
and obedient to all that are in authority, vile and lowly in its
own sight, devout and grateful towards God, faithful and always
trusting in Him even when God hideth His face, for without
sorrow we cannot live in love.</p>

<p id="id00374" class="calibre1">8. He who is not ready to suffer all things, and to conform to
the will of the Beloved, is not worthy to be called a lover of
God.  It behoveth him who loveth to embrace willingly all hard
and bitter things for the Beloved's sake, and not to be drawn
away from Him because of any contrary accidents.</p>

<p id="id00375" class="calibre1">(1) 2 Corinthians i. 3.</p>

<h4 id="id00376" class="calibre12">CHAPTER VI</h4>

<p id="id00377" class="calibre1">Of the proving of the true lover</p>

<p id="id00378" class="calibre1">"My Son, thou art not yet strong and prudent in thy love."</p>

<p id="id00379" class="calibre1">2. Wherefore, O my Lord?</p>

<p id="id00380" class="calibre1">3. "Because for a little opposition thou fallest away from thy
undertakings, and too eagerly seekest after consolation.  The
strong lover standeth fast in temptations, and believeth not the
evil persuasions of the enemy.  As in prosperity I please him, so
in adversity I do not displease.</p>

<p id="id00381" class="calibre1">4. "The prudent lover considereth not the gift of the lover so
much as the love of the giver.  He looketh for the affection more
than the value, and setteth all gifts lower than the Beloved.
The noble lover resteth not in the gift, but in Me above every
gift.</p>

<p id="id00382" class="calibre1">5. "All is not lost, though thou sometimes think of Me or of My
saints, less than thou shouldest desire.  That good and sweet
affection which thou sometimes perceivest is the effect of
present grace and some foretaste of the heavenly country; but
hereon thou must not too much depend, for it goeth and cometh.
But to strive against the evil motions of the mind which come to
us, and to resist the suggestions of the devil, is a token of
virtue and great merit.</p>

<p id="id00383" class="calibre1">6. "Therefore let not strange fancies disturb thee, whencesoever
they arise.  Bravely observe thy purpose and thy upright
intentions towards God.  It is not an illusion when thou art
sometimes suddenly carried away into rapture, and then suddenly
art brought back to the wonted vanities of thy heart.  For thou
dost rather unwillingly undergo them than cause them; and so long
as they displease thee and thou strivest against them, it is a
merit and no loss.</p>
