<h2 id="calibre_toc_12" class="calibre7">BOOK XI</h2><p class="calibre1">Lord, since eternity is Thine, art Thou ignorant of what I say to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee? or dost Thou see in time, what passeth in time? Why then do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">lay in order before Thee so many relations? Not, of a truth, that Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">mightest learn them through me, but to stir up mine own and my</p>
<p class="calibre1">readers’ devotions towards Thee, that we may all say, Great is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, and greatly to be praised. I have said already; and again will</p>
<p class="calibre1">say, for love of Thy love do I this. For we pray also, and yet Truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath said, Your Father knoweth what you have need of, before you</p>
<p class="calibre1">ask. It is then our affections which we lay open unto Thee, confessing</p>
<p class="calibre1">our own miseries, and Thy mercies upon us, that Thou mayest free us</p>
<p class="calibre1">wholly, since Thou hast begun, that we may cease to be wretched in</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves, and be blessed in Thee; seeing Thou hast called us, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">become poor in spirit, and meek, and mourners, and hungering and</p>
<p class="calibre1">athirst after righteousness, and merciful, and pure in heart, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">peacemakers. See, I have told Thee many things, as I could and as I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would, because Thou first wouldest that I should confess unto Thee, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord God. For Thou art good, for Thy mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how shall I suffice with the tongue of my pen to utter all Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhortations, and all Thy terrors, and comforts, and guidances,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby Thou broughtest me to preach Thy Word, and dispense Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sacrament to Thy people? And if I suffice to utter them in order,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the drops of time are precious with me; and long have I burned to</p>
<p class="calibre1">meditate in Thy law, and therein to confess to Thee my skill and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unskilfulness, the daybreak of Thy enlightening, and the remnants of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my darkness, until infirmity be swallowed up by strength. And I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not have aught besides steal away those hours which I find</p>
<p class="calibre1">free from the necessities of refreshing my body and the powers of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind, and of the service which we owe to men, or which though we owe</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, we yet pay.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O Lord my god, give ear unto my prayer, and let Thy mercy hearken</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto my desire: because it is anxious not for myself alone, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">would serve brotherly charity; and Thou seest my heart, that so it is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would sacrifice to Thee the service of my thought and tongue; do</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou give me, what I may offer Thee. For I am poor and needy, Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich to all that call upon Thee; Who, inaccessible to care, carest for</p>
<p class="calibre1">us. Circumcise from all rashness and all lying both my inward and</p>
<p class="calibre1">outward lips: let Thy Scriptures be my pure delights: let me not be</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceived in them, nor deceive out of them. Lord, hearken and pity, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord my God, Light of the blind, and Strength of the weak; yea also</p>
<p class="calibre1">Light of those that see, and Strength of the strong; hearken unto my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul, and hear it crying out of the depths. For if Thine ears be not</p>
<p class="calibre1">with us in the depths also, whither shall we go? whither cry? The</p>
<p class="calibre1">day is Thine, and the night is Thine; at Thy beck the moments flee by.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grant thereof a space for our meditations in the hidden things of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy law, and close it not against us who knock. For not in vain</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldest Thou have the darksome secrets of so many pages written;</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor are those forests without their harts which retire therein and</p>
<p class="calibre1">range and walk; feed, lie down, and ruminate. Perfect me, O Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and reveal them unto me. Behold, Thy voice is my joy; Thy voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceedeth the abundance of pleasures. Give what I love: for I do love;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and this hast Thou given: forsake not Thy own gifts, nor despise Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">green herb that thirsteth. Let me confess unto Thee whatsoever I shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">find in Thy books, and hear the voice of praise, and drink in Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and meditate on the wonderful things out of Thy law; even from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning, wherein Thou madest the heaven and the earth, unto the</p>
<p class="calibre1">everlasting reigning of Thy holy city with Thee.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, have mercy on me, and hear my desire. For it is not, I deem,</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the earth, not of gold and silver, and precious stones, or gorgeous</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparel, or honours and offices, or the pleasures of the flesh, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessaries for the body and for this life of our pilgrimage: all</p>
<p class="calibre1">which shall be added unto those that seek Thy kingdom and Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">righteousness. Behold, O Lord my God, wherein is my desire. The wicked</p>
<p class="calibre1">have told me of delights, but not such as Thy law, O Lord. Behold,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherein is my desire. Behold, Father, behold, and see and approve; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">be it pleasing in the sight of Thy mercy, that I may find grace before</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, that the inward parts of Thy words be opened to me knocking. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ Thy Son, the Man of Thy right hand,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Son of man, whom Thou hast established for Thyself, as Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mediator and ours, through Whom Thou soughtest us, not seeking Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but soughtest us, that we might seek Thee,- Thy Word, through Whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou madest all things, and among them, me also;- Thy Only-Begotten,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through Whom Thou calledst to adoption the believing people, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">therein me also;- I beseech Thee by Him, who sitteth at Thy right</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand, and intercedeth with Thee for us, in Whom are hidden all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">treasures of wisdom and knowledge. These do I seek in Thy books. Of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him did Moses write; this saith Himself; this saith the Truth.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I would hear and understand, how “In the Beginning Thou madest the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and earth.” Moses wrote this, wrote and departed, passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">hence from Thee to Thee; nor is he now before me. For if he were, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would hold him and ask him, and beseech him by Thee to open these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things unto me, and would lay the ears of my body to the sounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">bursting out of his mouth. And should he speak Hebrew, in vain will it</p>
<p class="calibre1">strike on my senses, nor would aught of it touch my mind; but if</p>
<p class="calibre1">Latin, I should know what he said. But whence should I know, whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">he spake truth? Yea, and if I knew this also, should I know it from</p>
<p class="calibre1">him? Truly within me, within, in the chamber of my thoughts, Truth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither Hebrew, nor Greek, nor Latin, nor barbarian, without organs of</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice or tongue, or sound of syllables, would say, “It is truth,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I forthwith should say confidently to that man of Thine, “thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">sayest truly.” Whereas then I cannot enquire of him, Thee, Thee I</p>
<p class="calibre1">beseech, O Truth, full of Whom he spake truth, Thee, my God, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">beseech, forgive my sins; and Thou, who gavest him Thy servant to</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak these things, give to me also to understand them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold, the heavens and the earth are; they proclaim that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were created; for they change and vary. Whereas whatsoever hath not</p>
<p class="calibre1">been made, and yet is, hath nothing in it, which before it had not;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and this it is, to change and vary. They proclaim also, that they made</p>
<p class="calibre1">not themselves; “therefore we are, because we have been made; we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were not therefore, before we were, so as to make ourselves.” Now</p>
<p class="calibre1">the evidence of the thing, is the voice of the speakers. Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore, Lord, madest them; who art beautiful, for they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful; who art good, for they are good; who art, for they are; yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">are they not beautiful nor good, nor are they, as Thou their Creator</p>
<p class="calibre1">art; compared with Whom, they are neither beautiful, nor good, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">are. This we know, thanks be to Thee. And our knowledge, compared with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy knowledge, is ignorance.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how didst Thou make the heaven and the earth? and what the</p>
<p class="calibre1">engine of Thy so mighty fabric? For it was not as a human artificer,</p>
<p class="calibre1">forming one body from another, according to the discretion of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind, which can in some way invest with such a form, as it seeth in</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself by its inward eye. And whence should he be able to do this,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless Thou hadst made that mind? and he invests with a form what</p>
<p class="calibre1">already existeth, and hath a being, as clay, or stone, or wood, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">gold, or the like. And whence should they be, hadst not Thou appointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">them? Thou madest the artificer his body, Thou the mind commanding the</p>
<p class="calibre1">limbs, Thou the matter whereof he makes any thing; Thou the</p>
<p class="calibre1">apprehension whereby to take in his art, and see within what he doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">without; Thou the sense of his body, whereby, as by an interpreter, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">may from mind to matter, convey that which he doth, and report to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his mind what is done; that it within may consult the truth, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">presideth over itself, whether it be well done or no. All these praise</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, the Creator of all. But how dost Thou make them? how, O God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst Thou make heaven and earth? Verily, neither in the heaven, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the earth, didst Thou make heaven and earth; nor in the air, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters, seeing these also belong to the heaven and the earth; nor in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the whole world didst Thou make the whole world; because there was</p>
<p class="calibre1">no place where to make it, before it was made, that it might be. Nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst Thou hold any thing in Thy hand, whereof to make heaven and</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth. For whence shouldest Thou have this, which Thou hadst not made,</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereof to make any thing? For what is, but because Thou art?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore Thou spokest, and they were made, and in Thy Word Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">madest them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how didst Thou speak? In the way that the voice came out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son? For that voice passed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">and passed away, began and ended; the syllables sounded and passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">away, the second after the first, the third after the second, and so</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth in order, until the last after the rest, and silence after the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last. Whence it is abundantly clear and plain that the motion of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">creature expressed it, itself temporal, serving Thy eternal will.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And these Thy words, created for a time, the outward ear reported to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the intelligent soul, whose inward ear lay listening to Thy Eternal</p>
<p class="calibre1">Word. But she compared these words sounding in time, with that Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eternal Word in silence, and said “It is different, far different.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These words are far beneath me, nor are they, because they flee and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pass away; but the Word of my Lord abideth above me for ever.” If then</p>
<p class="calibre1">in sounding and passing words Thou saidst that heaven and earth should</p>
<p class="calibre1">be made, and so madest heaven and earth, there was a corporeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">creature before heaven and earth, by whose motions in time that</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice might take his course in time. But there was nought corporeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">before heaven and earth; or if there were, surely Thou hadst,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without such a passing voice, created that, whereof to make this</p>
<p class="calibre1">passing voice, by which to say, Let the heaven and the earth be</p>
<p class="calibre1">made. For whatsoever that were, whereof such a voice were made, unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Thee it were made, it could not be at all. By what Word then</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst Thou speak, that a body might be made, whereby these words again</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be made?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou callest us then to understand the Word, God, with Thee God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Which is spoken eternally, and by It are all things spoken</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternally. For what was spoken was not spoken successively, one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing concluded that the next might be spoken, but all things together</p>
<p class="calibre1">and eternally. Else have we time and change; and not a true eternity</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor true immortality. This I know, O my God, and give thanks. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know, I confess to Thee, O Lord, and with me there knows and blesses</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, whoso is not unthankful to assure Truth. We know, Lord, we know;</p>
<p class="calibre1">since inasmuch as anything is not which was, and is, which was not, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">far forth it dieth and ariseth. Nothing then of Thy Word doth give</p>
<p class="calibre1">place or replace, because It is truly immortal and eternal. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore unto the Word coeternal with Thee Thou dost at once and</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternally say all that Thou dost say; and whatever Thou sayest shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">be made is made; nor dost Thou make, otherwise than by saying; and yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">are not all things made together, or everlasting, which Thou makest by</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, I beseech Thee, O Lord my God? I see it in a way; but how to</p>
<p class="calibre1">express it, I know not, unless it be, that whatsoever begins to be,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and leaves off to be, begins then, and leaves off then, when in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternal Reason it is known, that it ought to begin or leave off; in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Reason nothing beginneth or leaveth off. This is Thy Word, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is also “the Beginning, because also It speaketh unto us.” Thus in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gospel He speaketh through the flesh; and this sounded outwardly in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ears of men; that it might be believed and sought inwardly, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">found in the eternal Verity; where the good and only Master teacheth</p>
<p class="calibre1">all His disciples. There, Lord, hear I Thy voice speaking unto me;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because He speaketh us, who teacheth us; but He that teacheth us</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, though He speaketh, to us He speaketh not. Who now teacheth us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but the unchangeable Truth? for even when we are admonished through</p>
<p class="calibre1">a changeable creature; we are but led to the unchangeable Truth; where</p>
<p class="calibre1">we learn truly, while we stand and hear Him, and rejoice greatly</p>
<p class="calibre1">because of the Bridegroom’s voice, restoring us to Him, from Whom we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are. And therefore the Beginning, because unless It abided, there</p>
<p class="calibre1">should not, when we went astray, be whither to return. But when we</p>
<p class="calibre1">return from error, it is through knowing; and that we may know, He</p>
<p class="calibre1">teacheth us, because He is the Beginning, and speaking unto us.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this Beginning, O God, hast Thou made heaven and earth, in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Word, in Thy Son, in Thy Power, in Thy Wisdom, in Thy Truth;</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondrously speaking, and wondrously making. Who shall comprehend?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Who declare it? What is that which gleams through me, and strikes my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart without hurting it; and I shudder and kindle? I shudder,</p>
<p class="calibre1">inasmuch as I unlike it; I kindle, inasmuch as I am like it. It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wisdom, Wisdom’s self which gleameth through me; severing my</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloudiness which yet again mantles over me, fainting from it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the darkness which for my punishment gathers upon me. For my</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength is brought down in need, so that I cannot support my</p>
<p class="calibre1">blessings, till Thou, Lord, Who hast been gracious to all mine</p>
<p class="calibre1">iniquities, shalt heal all my infirmities. For Thou shalt also</p>
<p class="calibre1">redeem my life from corruption, and crown me with loving kindness</p>
<p class="calibre1">and tender mercies, and shalt satisfy my desire with good things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because my youth shall be renewed like an eagle’s. For in hope we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are saved, wherefore we through patience wait for Thy promises. Let</p>
<p class="calibre1">him that is able, hear Thee inwardly discoursing out of Thy oracle:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I will boldly cry out, How wonderful are Thy works, O Lord, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wisdom hast Thou made them all; and this Wisdom is the Beginning,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and in that Beginning didst Thou make heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lo, are they not full of their old leaven, who say to us, “What</p>
<p class="calibre1">was God doing before He made heaven and earth? For if (say they) He</p>
<p class="calibre1">were unemployed and wrought not, why does He not also henceforth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and for ever, as He did heretofore? For did any new motion arise in</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, and a new will to make a creature, which He had never before</p>
<p class="calibre1">made, how then would that be a true eternity, where there ariseth a</p>
<p class="calibre1">will, which was not? For the will of God is not a creature, but before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the creature; seeing nothing could be created, unless the will of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Creator had preceded. The will of God then belongeth to His very</p>
<p class="calibre1">Substance. And if aught have arisen in God’s Substance, which before</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not, that Substance cannot be truly called eternal. But if the</p>
<p class="calibre1">will of God has been from eternity that the creature should be, why</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not the creature also from eternity?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who speak thus, do not yet understand Thee, O Wisdom of God, Light</p>
<p class="calibre1">of souls, understand not yet how the things be made, which by Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and in Thee are made: yet they strive to comprehend things eternal,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whilst their heart fluttereth between the motions of things past and</p>
<p class="calibre1">to come, and is still unstable. Who shall hold it, and fix it, that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">be settled awhile, and awhile catch the glory of that everfixed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eternity, and compare it with the times which are never fixed, and see</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it cannot be compared; and that a long time cannot become long,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but out of many motions passing by, which cannot be prolonged</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether; but that in the Eternal nothing passeth, but the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">is present; whereas no time is all at once present: and that all</p>
<p class="calibre1">time past, is driven on by time to come, and all to come followeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the past; and all past and to come, is created, and flows out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of that which is ever present? Who shall hold the heart of man, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it may stand still, and see how eternity ever still-standing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither past nor to come, uttereth the times past and to come? Can</p>
<p class="calibre1">my hand do this, or the hand of my mouth by speech bring about a thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">so great?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">See, I answer him that asketh, “What did God before He made heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">and earth?” I answer not as one is said to have done merrily</p>
<p class="calibre1">(eluding the pressure of the question), “He was preparing hell</p>
<p class="calibre1">(saith he) for pryers into mysteries.” It is one thing to answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">enquiries, another to make sport of enquirers. So I answer not; for</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather had I answer, “I know not,” what I know not, than so as to</p>
<p class="calibre1">raise a laugh at him who asketh deep things and gain praise for one</p>
<p class="calibre1">who answereth false things. But I say that Thou, our God, art the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creator of every creature: and if by the name “heaven and earth,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">every creature be understood; I boldly say, “that before God made</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and earth, He did not make any thing.” For if He made, what did</p>
<p class="calibre1">He make but a creature? And would I knew whatsoever I desire to know</p>
<p class="calibre1">to my profit, as I know, that no creature was made, before there was</p>
<p class="calibre1">made any creature.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if any excursive brain rove over the images of forepassed times,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and wonder that Thou the God Almighty and All-creating and</p>
<p class="calibre1">All-supporting, Maker of heaven and earth, didst for innumerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">ages forbear from so great a work, before Thou wouldest make it; let</p>
<p class="calibre1">him awake and consider, that he wonders at false conceits. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">whence could innumerable ages pass by, which Thou madest not, Thou the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Author and Creator of all ages? or what times should there be, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">were not made by Thee? or how should they pass by, if they never were?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing then Thou art the Creator of all times, if any time was</p>
<p class="calibre1">before Thou madest heaven and earth, why say they that Thou didst</p>
<p class="calibre1">forego working? For that very time didst Thou make, nor could times</p>
<p class="calibre1">pass by, before Thou madest those times. But if before heaven and</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth there was no time, why is it demanded, what Thou then didst? For</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was no “then,” when there was no time.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor dost Thou by time, precede time: else shouldest Thou not precede</p>
<p class="calibre1">all times. But Thou precedest all things past, by the sublimity of</p>
<p class="calibre1">an ever-present eternity; and surpassest all future because they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">future, and when they come, they shall be past; but Thou art the Same,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Thy years fail not. Thy years neither come nor go; whereas ours</p>
<p class="calibre1">both come and go, that they all may come. Thy years stand together,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because they do stand; nor are departing thrust out by coming years,</p>
<p class="calibre1">for they pass not away; but ours shall all be, when they shall no more</p>
<p class="calibre1">be. Thy years are one day; and Thy day is not daily, but To-day,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing Thy To-day gives not place unto tomorrow, for neither doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">it replace yesterday. Thy To-day, is Eternity; therefore didst Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">beget The Coeternal, to whom Thou saidst, This day have I begotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. Thou hast made all things; and before all times Thou art:</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither in any time was time not.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">At no time then hadst Thou not made any thing, because time itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou madest. And no times are coeternal with Thee, because Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">abidest; but if they abode, they should not be times. For what is</p>
<p class="calibre1">time? Who can readily and briefly explain this? Who can even in</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought comprehend it, so as to utter a word about it? But what in</p>
<p class="calibre1">discourse do we mention more familiarly and knowingly, than time? And,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we understand, when we speak of it; we understand also, when we hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">it spoken of by another. What then is time? If no one asks me, I know:</p>
<p class="calibre1">if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not: yet I say</p>
<p class="calibre1">boldly that I know, that if nothing passed away, time past were not;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and if nothing were coming, a time to come were not; and if nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">were, time present were not. Those two times then, past and to come,</p>
<p class="calibre1">how are they, seeing the past now is not, and that to come is not yet?</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the present, should it always be present, and never pass into time</p>
<p class="calibre1">past, verily it should not be time, but eternity. If time present</p>
<p class="calibre1">(if it is to be time) only cometh into existence, because it passeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">into time past, how can we say that either this is, whose cause of</p>
<p class="calibre1">being is, that it shall not be; so, namely, that we cannot truly say</p>
<p class="calibre1">that time is, but because it is tending not to be?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet we say, “a long time” and “a short time”; still, only of</p>
<p class="calibre1">time past or to come. A long time past (for example) we call an</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred years since; and a long time to come, an hundred years</p>
<p class="calibre1">hence. But a short time past, we call (suppose) often days since;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and a short time to come, often days hence. But in what sense is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that long or short, which is not? For the past, is not now; and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">future, is not yet. Let us not then say, “it is long”; but of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past, “it hath been long”; and of the future, “it will be long.” O</p>
<p class="calibre1">my Lord, my Light, shall not here also Thy Truth mock at man? For that</p>
<p class="calibre1">past time which was long, was it long when it was now past, or when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was yet present? For then might it be long, when there was, what could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be long; but when past, it was no longer; wherefore neither could that</p>
<p class="calibre1">be long, which was not at all. Let us not then say, “time past hath</p>
<p class="calibre1">been long”: for we shall not find, what hath been long, seeing that</p>
<p class="calibre1">since it was past, it is no more, but let us say, “that present time</p>
<p class="calibre1">was long”; because, when it was present, it was long. For it had not</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet passed away, so as not to be; and therefore there was, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be long; but after it was past, that ceased also to be long,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which ceased to be.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let us see then, thou soul of man, whether present time can be long:</p>
<p class="calibre1">for to thee it is given to feel and to measure length of time. What</p>
<p class="calibre1">wilt thou answer me? Are an hundred years, when present, a long</p>
<p class="calibre1">time? See first, whether an hundred years can be present. For if the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first of these years be now current, it is present, but the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">ninety and nine are to come, and therefore are not yet, but if the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second year be current, one is now past, another present, the rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">to come. And so if we assume any middle year of this hundred to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">present, all before it, are past; all after it, to come; wherefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">an hundred years cannot be present. But see at least whether that</p>
<p class="calibre1">one which is now current, itself is present; for if the current</p>
<p class="calibre1">month be its first, the rest are to come; if the second, the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">is already past, and the rest are not yet. Therefore, neither is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">year now current present; and if not present as a whole, then is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the year present. For twelve months are a year; of which whatever by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the current month is present; the rest past, or to come. Although</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither is that current month present; but one day only; the rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">being to come, if it be the first; past, if the last; if any of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle, then amid past and to come.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">See how the present time, which alone we found could be called long,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is abridged to the length scarce of one day. But let us examine that</p>
<p class="calibre1">also; because neither is one day present as a whole. For it is made up</p>
<p class="calibre1">of four and twenty hours of night and day: of which, the first hath</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rest to come; the last hath them past; and any of the middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath those before it past, those behind it to come. Yea, that one hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">passeth away in flying particles. Whatsoever of it hath flown away, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">past; whatsoever remaineth, is to come. If an instant of time be</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceived, which cannot be divided into the smallest particles of</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments, that alone is it, which may be called present. Which yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">flies with such speed from future to past, as not to be lengthened out</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the least stay. For if it be, it is divided into past and future.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The present hath no space. Where then is the time, which we may call</p>
<p class="calibre1">long? Is it to come? Of it we do not say, “it is long”; because it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is not yet, so as to be long; but we say, “it will be long.” When</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore will it be? For if even then, when it is yet to come, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall not be long (because what can be long, as yet is not), and so it</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall then be long, when from future which as yet is not, it shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin now to be, and have become present, that so there should exist</p>
<p class="calibre1">what may be long; then does time present cry out in the words above,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it cannot be long.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet, Lord, we perceive intervals of times, and compare them, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">say, some are shorter, and others longer. We measure also, how much</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer or shorter this time is than that; and we answer, “This is</p>
<p class="calibre1">double, or treble; and that, but once, or only just so much as</p>
<p class="calibre1">that.” But we measure times as they are passing, by perceiving them;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but past, which now are not, or the future, which are not yet, who can</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure? unless a man shall presume to say, that can be measured,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is not. When then time is passing, it may be perceived and</p>
<p class="calibre1">measured; but when it is past, it cannot, because it is not.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I ask, Father, I affirm not: O my God, rule and guide me. “Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">will tell me that there are not three times (as we learned when</p>
<p class="calibre1">boys, and taught boys), past, present, and future; but present only,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because those two are not? Or are they also; and when from future it</p>
<p class="calibre1">becometh present, doth it come out of some secret place; and so,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when retiring, from present it becometh past? For where did they,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who foretold things to come, see them, if as yet they be not? For that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is not, cannot be seen. And they who relate things past, could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not relate them, if in mind they did not discern them, and if they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were not, they could no way be discerned. Things then past and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come, are.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Permit me, Lord, to seek further. O my hope, let not my purpose be</p>
<p class="calibre1">confounded. For if times past and to come be, I would know where</p>
<p class="calibre1">they be. Which yet if I cannot, yet I know, wherever they be, they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not there as future, or past, but present. For if there also they be</p>
<p class="calibre1">future, they are not yet there; if there also they be past, they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">no longer there. Wheresoever then is whatsoever is, it is only as</p>
<p class="calibre1">present. Although when past facts are related, there are drawn out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the memory, not the things themselves which are past, but words</p>
<p class="calibre1">which, conceived by the images of the things, they, in passing, have</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the senses left as traces in the mind. Thus my childhood,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which now is not, is in time past, which now is not: but now when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">recall its image, and tell of it, I behold it in the present,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it is still in my memory. Whether there be a like cause of</p>
<p class="calibre1">foretelling things to come also; that of things which as yet are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, the images may be perceived before, already existing, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess, O my God, I know not. This indeed I know, that we generally</p>
<p class="calibre1">think before on our future actions, and that that forethinking is</p>
<p class="calibre1">present, but the action whereof we forethink is not yet, because it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">to come. Which, when we have set upon, and have begun to do what we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were forethinking, then shall that action be; because then it is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer future, but present.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which way soever then this secret fore-perceiving of things to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come be; that only can be seen, which is. But what now is, is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">future, but present. When then things to come are said to be seen,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is not themselves which as yet are not (that is, which are to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be), but their causes perchance or signs are seen, which already</p>
<p class="calibre1">are. Therefore they are not future but present to those who now see</p>
<p class="calibre1">that, from which the future, being foreconceived in the mind, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">foretold. Which fore-conceptions again now are; and those who foretell</p>
<p class="calibre1">those things, do behold the conceptions present before them. Let now</p>
<p class="calibre1">the numerous variety of things furnish me some example. I behold the</p>
<p class="calibre1">daybreak, I foreshow, that the sun, is about to rise. What I</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold, is present; what I foresignify, to come; not the sun, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">already is; but the sun-rising, which is not yet. And yet did I not in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my mind imagine the sun-rising itself (as now while I speak of it),</p>
<p class="calibre1">I could not foretell it. But neither is that daybreak which I discern</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the sky, the sun-rising, although it goes before it; nor that</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination of my mind; which two are seen now present, that the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is to be may be foretold. Future things then are not yet: and if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they be not yet, they are not: and if they are not, they cannot be</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen; yet foretold they may be from things present, which are already,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and are seen.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou then, Ruler of Thy creation, by what way dost Thou teach</p>
<p class="calibre1">souls things to come? For Thou didst teach Thy Prophets. By what way</p>
<p class="calibre1">dost Thou, to whom nothing is to come, teach things to come; or rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the future, dost teach things present? For, what is not, neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">can it be taught. Too far is this way of my ken: it is too mighty</p>
<p class="calibre1">for me, I cannot attain unto it; but from Thee I can, when Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">shalt vouchsafe it, O sweet light of my hidden eyes.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What now is clear and plain is, that neither things to come nor past</p>
<p class="calibre1">are. Nor is it properly said, “there be three times, past, present,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and to come”: yet perchance it might be properly said, “there be three</p>
<p class="calibre1">times; a present of things past, a present of things present, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">present of things future.” For these three do exist in some sort, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the soul, but otherwhere do I not see them; present of things past,</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory; present of things present, sight; present of things future,</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectation. If thus we be permitted to speak, I see three times,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I confess there are three. Let it be said too, “there be three</p>
<p class="calibre1">times, past, present, and to come”: in our incorrect way. See, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">object not, nor gainsay, nor find fault, if what is so said be but</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood, that neither what is to be, now is, nor what is past.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For but few things are there, which we speak properly, most things</p>
<p class="calibre1">improperly; still the things intended are understood.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I said then even now, we measure times as they pass, in order to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be able to say, this time is twice so much as that one; or, this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">just so much as that; and so of any other parts of time, which be</p>
<p class="calibre1">measurable. Wherefore, as I said, we measure times as they pass. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">if any should ask me, “How knowest thou?” I might answer, “I know,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we do measure, nor can we measure things that are not; and things</p>
<p class="calibre1">past and to come, are not.” But time present how do we measure, seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">it hath no space? It is measured while passing, but when it shall have</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed, it is not measured; for there will be nothing to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">measured. But whence, by what way, and whither passes it while it is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">measuring? whence, but from the future? Which way, but through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">present? whither, but into the past? From that therefore, which is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet, through that, which hath no space, into that, which now is not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet what do we measure, if not time in some space? For we do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">say, single, and double, and triple, and equal, or any other like</p>
<p class="calibre1">way that we speak of time, except of spaces of times. In what space</p>
<p class="calibre1">then do we measure time passing? In the future, whence it passeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">through? But what is not yet, we measure not. Or in the present, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">which it passes? but no space, we do not measure: or in the past, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">which it passes? But neither do we measure that, which now is not.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">My soul is on fire to know this most intricate enigma. Shut it not</p>
<p class="calibre1">up, O Lord my God, good Father; through Christ I beseech Thee, do</p>
<p class="calibre1">not shut up these usual, yet hidden things, from my desire, that it be</p>
<p class="calibre1">hindered from piercing into them; but let them dawn through Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">enlightening mercy, O Lord. Whom shall I enquire of concerning these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things? and to whom shall I more fruitfully confess my ignorance, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thee, to Whom these my studies, so vehemently kindled toward Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scriptures, are not troublesome? Give what I love; for I do love,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and this hast Thou given me. Give, Father, Who truly knowest to give</p>
<p class="calibre1">good gifts unto Thy children. Give, because I have taken upon me to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know, and trouble is before me until Thou openest it. By Christ I</p>
<p class="calibre1">beseech Thee, in His Name, Holy of holies, let no man disturb me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For I believed, and therefore do I speak. This is my hope, for this do</p>
<p class="calibre1">I live, that I may contemplate the delights of the Lord. Behold,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast made my days old, and they pass away, and how, I know not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And we talk of time, and time, and times, and times, “How long time is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it since he said this”; “how long time since he did this”; and “how</p>
<p class="calibre1">long time since I saw that”; and “this syllable hath double time to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that single short syllable.” These words we speak, and these we</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear, and are understood, and understand. Most manifest and ordinary</p>
<p class="calibre1">they are, and the self-same things again are but too deeply hidden,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the discovery of them were new.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard once from a learned man, that the motions of the sun,</p>
<p class="calibre1">moon, and stars, constituted time, and I assented not. For why</p>
<p class="calibre1">should not the motions of all bodies rather be times? Or, if the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lights of heaven should cease, and a potter’s wheel run round,</p>
<p class="calibre1">should there be no time by which we might measure those whirlings, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">say, that either it moved with equal pauses, or if it turned sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">slower, otherwhiles quicker, that some rounds were longer, other</p>
<p class="calibre1">shorter? Or, while we were saying this, should we not also be speaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">in time? Or, should there in our words be some syllables short, others</p>
<p class="calibre1">long, but because those sounded in a shorter time, these in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer? God, grant to men to see in a small thing notices common to</p>
<p class="calibre1">things great and small. The stars and lights of heaven, are also for</p>
<p class="calibre1">signs, and for seasons, and for years, and for days; they are; yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither should I say, that the going round of that wooden wheel was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a day, nor yet he, that it was therefore no time.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I desire to know the force and nature of time, by which we measure</p>
<p class="calibre1">the motions of bodies, and say (for example) this motion is twice as</p>
<p class="calibre1">long as that. For I ask, Seeing “day” denotes not the stay only of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun upon the earth (according to which day is one thing, night</p>
<p class="calibre1">another); but also its whole circuit from east to east again;</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to which we say, “there passed so many days,” the night</p>
<p class="calibre1">being included when we say, “so many days,” and the nights not</p>
<p class="calibre1">reckoned apart;- seeing then a day is completed by the motion of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun and by his circuit from east to east again, I ask, does the motion</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone make the day, or the stay in which that motion is completed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or both? For if the first be the day; then should we have a day,</p>
<p class="calibre1">although the sun should finish that course in so small a space of</p>
<p class="calibre1">time, as one hour comes to. If the second, then should not that make a</p>
<p class="calibre1">day, if between one sun-rise and another there were but so short a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay, as one hour comes to; but the sun must go four and twenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">times about, to complete one day. If both, then neither could that</p>
<p class="calibre1">be called a day; if the sun should run his whole round in the space of</p>
<p class="calibre1">one hour; nor that, if, while the sun stood still, so much time should</p>
<p class="calibre1">overpass, as the sun usually makes his whole course in, from morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">to morning. I will not therefore now ask, what that is which is called</p>
<p class="calibre1">day; but, what time is, whereby we, measuring the circuit of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun, should say that it was finished in half the time it was wont,</p>
<p class="calibre1">if so be it was finished in so small a space as twelve hours; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">comparing both times, should call this a single time, that a double</p>
<p class="calibre1">time; even supposing the sun to run his round from east to east,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes in that single, sometimes in that double time. Let no man</p>
<p class="calibre1">then tell me, that the motions of the heavenly bodies constitute</p>
<p class="calibre1">times, because, when at the prayer of one, the sun had stood still,</p>
<p class="calibre1">till he could achieve his victorious battle, the sun stood still,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but time went on. For in its own allotted space of time was that</p>
<p class="calibre1">battle waged and ended. I perceive time then to be a certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">extension. But do I perceive it, or seem to perceive it? Thou, Light</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Truth, wilt show me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dost Thou bid me assent, if any define time to be “motion of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">body?” Thou dost not bid me. For that no body is moved, but in time, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear; this Thou sayest; but that the motion of a body is time, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear not; Thou sayest it not. For when a body is moved, I by time</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure, how long it moveth, from the time it began to move until it</p>
<p class="calibre1">left off? And if I did not see whence it began; and it continue to</p>
<p class="calibre1">move so that I see not when it ends, I cannot measure, save</p>
<p class="calibre1">perchance from the time I began, until I cease to see. And if I look</p>
<p class="calibre1">long, I can only pronounce it to be a long time, but not how long;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because when we say “how long,” we do it by comparison; as, “this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">as long as that,” or “twice so long as that,” or the like. But when we</p>
<p class="calibre1">can mark the distances of the places, whence and whither goeth the</p>
<p class="calibre1">body moved, or his parts, if it moved as in a lathe, then can we say</p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely, in how much time the motion of that body or his part,</p>
<p class="calibre1">from this place unto that, was finished. Seeing therefore the motion</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a body is one thing, that by which we measure how long it is,</p>
<p class="calibre1">another; who sees not, which of the two is rather to be called time?</p>
<p class="calibre1">For and if a body be sometimes moved, sometimes stands still, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">we measure, not his motion only, but his standing still too by time;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and we say, “it stood still, as much as it moved”; or “it stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">still twice or thrice so long as it moved”; or any other space which</p>
<p class="calibre1">our measuring hath either ascertained, or guessed; more or less, as we</p>
<p class="calibre1">use to say. Time then is not the motion of a body.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I confess to Thee, O Lord, that I yet know not what time is, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">again I confess unto Thee, O Lord, that I know that I speak this in</p>
<p class="calibre1">time, and that having long spoken of time, that very “long” is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">long, but by the pause of time. How then know I this, seeing I know</p>
<p class="calibre1">not what time is? or is it perchance that I know not how to express</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I know? Woe is me, that do not even know, what I know not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold, O my God, before Thee I lie not; but as I speak, so is my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart. Thou shalt light my candle; Thou, O Lord my God, wilt enlighten</p>
<p class="calibre1">my darkness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Does not my soul most truly confess unto Thee, that I do measure</p>
<p class="calibre1">times? Do I then measure, O my God, and know not what I measure? I</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure the motion of a body in time; and the time itself do I not</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure? Or could I indeed measure the motion of a body how long it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were, and in how long space it could come from this place to that,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without measuring the time in which it is moved? This same time</p>
<p class="calibre1">then, how do I measure? do we by a shorter time measure a longer, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the space of a cubit, the space of a rood? for so indeed we seem by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the space of a short syllable, to measure the space of a long</p>
<p class="calibre1">syllable, and to say that this is double the other. Thus measure we</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spaces of stanzas, by the spaces of the verses, and the spaces</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the verses, by the spaces of the feet, and the spaces of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet, by the spaces of the syllables, and the spaces of long, by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">space of short syllables; not measuring by pages (for then we</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure spaces, not times); but when we utter the words and they</p>
<p class="calibre1">pass by, and we say “it is a long stanza, because composed of so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many verses; long verses, because consisting of so many feet; long</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet, because prolonged by so many syllables; a long syllable</p>
<p class="calibre1">because double to a short one. But neither do we this way obtain any</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain measure of time; because it may be, that a shorter verse,</p>
<p class="calibre1">pronounced more fully, may take up more time than a longer, pronounced</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurriedly. And so for a verse, a foot, a syllable. Whence it seemed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, that time is nothing else than protraction; but of what, I know</p>
<p class="calibre1">not; and I marvel, if it be not of the mind itself? For what, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">beseech Thee, O my God, do I measure, when I say, either</p>
<p class="calibre1">indefinitely “this is a longer time than that,” or definitely “this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">double that”? That I measure time, I know; and yet I measure not</p>
<p class="calibre1">time to come, for it is not yet; nor present, because it is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">protracted by any space; nor past, because it now is not. What then do</p>
<p class="calibre1">I measure? Times passing, not past? for so I said.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Courage, my mind, and press on mightily. God is our helper, He</p>
<p class="calibre1">made us, and not we ourselves. Press on where truth begins to dawn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suppose, now, the voice of a body begins to sound, and does sound, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds on, and list, it ceases; it is silence now, and that voice is</p>
<p class="calibre1">past, and is no more a voice. Before it sounded, it was to come, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">could not be measured, because as yet it was not, and now it cannot,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it is no longer. Then therefore while it sounded, it might;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because there then was what might be measured. But yet even then it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not at a stay; for it was passing on, and passing away. Could it</p>
<p class="calibre1">be measured the rather, for that? For while passing, it was being</p>
<p class="calibre1">extended into some space of time, so that it might be measured,</p>
<p class="calibre1">since the present hath no space. If therefore then it might, then, to,</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose another voice hath begun to sound, and still soundeth in one</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued tenor without any interruption; let us measure it while it</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds; seeing when it hath left sounding, it will then be past, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing left to be measured; let us measure it verily, and tell how</p>
<p class="calibre1">much it is. But it sounds still, nor can it be measured but from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant it began in, unto the end it left in. For the very space</p>
<p class="calibre1">between is the thing we measure, namely, from some beginning unto some</p>
<p class="calibre1">end. Wherefore, a voice that is not yet ended, cannot be measured,</p>
<p class="calibre1">so that it may be said how long, or short it is; nor can it be</p>
<p class="calibre1">called equal to another, or double to a single, or the like. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">when ended, it no longer is. How may it then be measured? And yet we</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure times; but yet neither those which are not yet, nor those</p>
<p class="calibre1">which no longer are, nor those which are not lengthened out by some</p>
<p class="calibre1">pause, nor those which have no bounds. We measure neither times to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come, nor past, nor present, nor passing; and yet we do measure times.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Deus Creator omnium,” this verse of eight syllables alternates</p>
<p class="calibre1">between short and long syllables. The four short then, the first,</p>
<p class="calibre1">third, fifth, and seventh, are but single, in respect of the four</p>
<p class="calibre1">long, the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth. Every one of these to</p>
<p class="calibre1">every one of those, hath a double time: I pronounce them, report on</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, and find it so, as one’s plain sense perceives. By plain sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">then, I measure a long syllable by a short, and I sensibly find it</p>
<p class="calibre1">to have twice so much; but when one sounds after the other, if the</p>
<p class="calibre1">former be short, the latter long, how shall I detain the short one,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and how, measuring, shall I apply it to the long, that I may find this</p>
<p class="calibre1">to have twice so much; seeing the long does not begin to sound, unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">the short leaves sounding? And that very long one do I measure as</p>
<p class="calibre1">present, seeing I measure it not till it be ended? Now his ending is</p>
<p class="calibre1">his passing away. What then is it I measure? where is the short</p>
<p class="calibre1">syllable by which I measure? where the long which I measure? Both have</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounded, have flown, passed away, are no more; and yet I measure,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and confidently answer (so far as is presumed on a practised sense)</p>
<p class="calibre1">that as to space of time this syllable is but single, that double. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet I could not do this, unless they were already past and ended. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is not then themselves, which now are not, that I measure, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">something in my memory, which there remains fixed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is in thee, my mind, that I measure times. Interrupt me not, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is, interrupt not thyself with the tumults of thy impressions. In thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">I measure times; the impression, which things as they pass by cause in</p>
<p class="calibre1">thee, remains even when they are gone; this it is which still present,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I measure, not the things which pass by to make this impression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This I measure, when I measure times. Either then this is time, or I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do not measure times. What when we measure silence, and say that</p>
<p class="calibre1">this silence hath held as long time as did that voice? do we not</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretch out our thought to the measure of a voice, as if it sounded,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that so we may be able to report of the intervals of silence in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">given space of time? For though both voice and tongue be still, yet in</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought we go over poems, and verses, and any other discourse, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">dimensions of motions, and report as to the spaces of times, how</p>
<p class="calibre1">much this is in respect of that, no otherwise than if vocally we did</p>
<p class="calibre1">pronounce them. If a man would utter a lengthened sound, and had</p>
<p class="calibre1">settled in thought how long it should be, he hath in silence already</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone through a space of time, and committing it to memory, begins to</p>
<p class="calibre1">utter that speech, which sounds on, until it be brought unto the end</p>
<p class="calibre1">proposed. Yea it hath sounded, and will sound; for so much of it as is</p>
<p class="calibre1">finished, hath sounded already, and the rest will sound. And thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">passeth it on, until the present intent conveys over the future into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the past; the past increasing by the diminution of the future, until</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the consumption of the future, all is past.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how is that future diminished or consumed, which as yet is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not? or how that past increased, which is now no longer, save that</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the mind which enacteth this, there be three things done? For it</p>
<p class="calibre1">expects, it considers, it remembers; that so that which it</p>
<p class="calibre1">expecteth, through that which it considereth, passeth into that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which it remembereth. Who therefore denieth, that things to come are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not as yet? and yet, there is in the mind an expectation of things</p>
<p class="calibre1">to come. And who denies past things to be now no longer? and yet is</p>
<p class="calibre1">there still in the mind a memory of things past. And who denieth the</p>
<p class="calibre1">present time hath no space, because it passeth away in a moment? and</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet our consideration continueth, through which that which shall be</p>
<p class="calibre1">present proceedeth to become absent. It is not then future time,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is long, for as yet it is not: but a long future, is “a long</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectation of the future,” nor is it time past, which now is not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is long; but a long past, is “a long memory of the past.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I am about to repeat a Psalm that I know. Before I begin, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectation is extended over the whole; but when I have begun, how</p>
<p class="calibre1">much soever of it I shall separate off into the past, is extended</p>
<p class="calibre1">along my memory; thus the life of this action of mine is divided</p>
<p class="calibre1">between my memory as to what I have repeated, and expectation as to</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I am about to repeat; but “consideration” is present with me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that through it what was future, may be conveyed over, so as to become</p>
<p class="calibre1">past. Which the more it is done again and again, so much the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">the expectation being shortened, is the memory enlarged: till the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole expectation be at length exhausted, when that whole action being</p>
<p class="calibre1">ended, shall have passed into memory. And this which takes place in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the whole Psalm, the same takes place in each several portion of it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and each several syllable; the same holds in that longer action,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereof this Psalm may be part; the same holds in the whole life of</p>
<p class="calibre1">man, whereof all the actions of man are parts; the same holds</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the whole age of the sons of men, whereof all the lives of men</p>
<p class="calibre1">are parts.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But because Thy loving-kindness is better than all lives, behold, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">life is but a distraction, and Thy right hand upheld me, in my Lord</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Son of man, the Mediator betwixt Thee, The One, and us many,</p>
<p class="calibre1">many also through our manifold distractions amid many things, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Him I may apprehend in Whom I have been apprehended, and may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">recollected from my old conversation, to follow The One, forgetting</p>
<p class="calibre1">what is behind, and not distended but extended, not to things which</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall be and shall pass away, but to those things which are before,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not distractedly but intently, I follow on for the prize of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavenly calling, where I may hear the voice of Thy praise, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemplate Thy delights, neither to come, nor to pass away. But now</p>
<p class="calibre1">are my years spent in mourning. And Thou, O Lord, art my comfort, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">Father everlasting, but I have been severed amid times, whose order</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know not; and my thoughts, even the inmost bowels of my soul, are</p>
<p class="calibre1">rent and mangled with tumultuous varieties, until I flow together into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, purified and molten by the fire of Thy love.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now will I stand, and become firm in Thee, in my mould, Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth; nor will I endure the questions of men, who by a penal</p>
<p class="calibre1">disease thirst for more than they can contain, and say, “what did</p>
<p class="calibre1">God before He made heaven and earth?” Or, “How came it into His mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">to make any thing, having never before made any thing?” Give them, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, well to bethink themselves what they say, and to find, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">“never” cannot be predicated, when “time” is not. This then that He is</p>
<p class="calibre1">said “never to have made”; what else is it to say, than “in ‘no have</p>
<p class="calibre1">made?” Let them see therefore, that time cannot be without created</p>
<p class="calibre1">being, and cease to speak that vanity. May they also be extended</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards those things which are before; and understand Thee before</p>
<p class="calibre1">all times, the eternal Creator of all times, and that no times be</p>
<p class="calibre1">coeternal with Thee, nor any creature, even if there be any creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">before all times.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O Lord my God, what a depth is that recess of Thy mysteries, and how</p>
<p class="calibre1">far from it have the consequences of my transgressions cast me! Heal</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine eyes, that I may share the joy of Thy light. Certainly, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">there be mind gifted with such vast knowledge and foreknowledge, as to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know all things past and to come, as I know one well-known Psalm,</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly that mind is passing wonderful, and fearfully amazing; in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing past, nothing to come in after-ages, is any more hidden from</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, than when I sung that Psalm, was hidden from me what, and how</p>
<p class="calibre1">much of it had passed away from the beginning, what, and how much</p>
<p class="calibre1">there remained unto the end. But far be it that Thou the Creator of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Universe, the Creator of souls and bodies, far be it, that Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldest in such wise know all things past and to come. Far, far more</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderfully, and far more mysteriously, dost Thou know them. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, as the feelings of one who singeth what he knoweth, or heareth</p>
<p class="calibre1">some well-known song, are through expectation of the words to come,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the remembering of those that are past, varied, and his senses</p>
<p class="calibre1">divided, -not so doth any thing happen unto Thee, unchangeably</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternal, that is, the eternal Creator of minds. Like then as Thou in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Beginning knewest the heaven and the earth, without any variety of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy knowledge, so madest Thou in the Beginning heaven and earth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without any distraction of Thy action. Whoso understandeth, let him</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess unto Thee; and whoso understandeth not, let him confess unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. Oh how high art Thou, and yet the humble in heart are Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwelling-place; for Thou raisest up those that are bowed down, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they fall not, whose elevation Thou art.</p>
