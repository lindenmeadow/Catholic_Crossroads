<h2 id="calibre_toc_3" class="calibre7">BOOK II</h2><p class="calibre1">I will now call to mind my past foulness, and the carnal corruptions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my soul; not because I love them, but that I may love Thee, O my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God. For love of Thy love I do it; reviewing my most wicked ways in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the very bitterness of my remembrance, that Thou mayest grow sweet</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto me (Thou sweetness never failing, Thou blissful and assured</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweetness); and gathering me again out of that my dissipation, wherein</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was torn piecemeal, while turned from Thee, the One Good, I lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself among a multiplicity of things. For I even burnt in my youth</p>
<p class="calibre1">heretofore, to be satiated in things below; and I dared to grow wild</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, with these various and shadowy loves: my beauty consumed</p>
<p class="calibre1">away, and I stank in Thine eyes; pleasing myself, and desirous to</p>
<p class="calibre1">please in the eyes of men.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what was it that I delighted in, but to love, and be loved?</p>
<p class="calibre1">but I kept not the measure of love, of mind to mind, friendship’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright boundary: but out of the muddy concupiscence of the flesh,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the bubblings of youth, mists fumed up which beclouded and</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcast my heart, that I could not discern the clear brightness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">love from the fog of lustfulness. Both did confusedly boil in me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and hurried my unstayed youth over the precipice of unholy desires,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sunk me in a gulf of flagitiousnesses. Thy wrath had gathered over</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, and I knew it not. I was grown deaf by the clanking of the chain</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my mortality, the punishment of the pride of my soul, and I strayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">further from Thee, and Thou lettest me alone, and I was tossed</p>
<p class="calibre1">about, and wasted, and dissipated, and I boiled over in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fornications, and Thou heldest Thy peace, O Thou my tardy joy! Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">then heldest Thy peace, and I wandered further and further from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, into more and more fruitless seed-plots of sorrows, with a proud</p>
<p class="calibre1">dejectedness, and a restless weariness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh! that some one had then attempered my disorder, and turned to</p>
<p class="calibre1">account the fleeting beauties of these, the extreme points of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">creation! had put a bound to their pleasureableness, that so the tides</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my youth might have cast themselves upon the marriage shore, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they could not be calmed, and kept within the object of a family, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy law prescribes, O Lord: who this way formest the offspring of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">our death, being able with a gentle hand to blunt the thorns which</p>
<p class="calibre1">were excluded from Thy paradise? For Thy omnipotency is not far from</p>
<p class="calibre1">us, even when we be far from Thee. Else ought I more watchfully to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have heeded the voice from the clouds: Nevertheless such shall have</p>
<p class="calibre1">trouble in the flesh, but I spare you. And it is good for a man not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">touch a woman. And, he that is unmarried thinketh of the things of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he that is married careth for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the things of this world, how he may please his wife.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">To these words I should have listened more attentively, and being</p>
<p class="calibre1">severed for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, had more happily awaited Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">embraces; but I, poor wretch, foamed like a troubled sea, following</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rushing of my own tide, forsaking Thee, and exceeded all Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">limits; yet I escaped not Thy scourges. For what mortal can? For</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou wert ever with me mercifully rigorous, and besprinkling with most</p>
<p class="calibre1">bitter alloy all my unlawful pleasures: that I might seek pleasures</p>
<p class="calibre1">without alloy. But where to find such, I could not discover, save in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, O Lord, who teachest by sorrow, and woundest us, to heal; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">killest us, lest we die from Thee. Where was I, and how far was I</p>
<p class="calibre1">exiled from the delights of Thy house, in that sixteenth year of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">age of my flesh, when the madness of lust (to which human</p>
<p class="calibre1">shamelessness giveth free licence, though unlicensed by Thy laws) took</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rule over me, and I resigned myself wholly to it? My friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">meanwhile took no care by marriage to save my fall; their only care</p>
<p class="calibre1">was that I should learn to speak excellently, and be a persuasive</p>
<p class="calibre1">orator.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For that year were my studies intermitted: whilst after my return</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Madaura (a neighbour city, whither I had journeyed to learn</p>
<p class="calibre1">grammar and rhetoric), the expenses for a further journey to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carthage were being provided for me; and that rather by the resolution</p>
<p class="calibre1">than the means of my father, who was but a poor freeman of Thagaste.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To whom tell I this? not to Thee, my God; but before Thee to mine</p>
<p class="calibre1">own kind, even to that small portion of mankind as may light upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">these writings of mine. And to what purpose? that whosoever reads</p>
<p class="calibre1">this, may think out of what depths we are to cry unto Thee. For what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is nearer to Thine ears than a confessing heart, and a life of</p>
<p class="calibre1">faith? Who did not extol my father, for that beyond the ability of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">means, he would furnish his son with all necessaries for a far journey</p>
<p class="calibre1">for his studies’ sake? For many far abler citizens did no such thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">for their children. But yet this same father had no concern how I grew</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards Thee, or how chaste I were; so that I were but copious in</p>
<p class="calibre1">speech, however barren I were to Thy culture, O God, who art the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only true and good Lord of Thy field, my heart.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But while in that my sixteenth year I lived with my parents, leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">all school for a while (a season of idleness being interposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the narrowness of my parents’ fortunes), the briers of unclean</p>
<p class="calibre1">desires grew rank over my head, and there was no hand to root them</p>
<p class="calibre1">out. When that my father saw me at the baths, now growing towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">manhood, and endued with a restless youthfulness, he, as already hence</p>
<p class="calibre1">anticipating his descendants, gladly told it to my mother; rejoicing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that tumult of the senses wherein the world forgetteth Thee its</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creator, and becometh enamoured of Thy creature, instead of Thyself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the fumes of that invisible wine of its self-will, turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">aside and bowing down to the very basest things. But in my mother’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">breast Thou hadst already begun Thy temple, and the foundation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy holy habitation, whereas my father was as yet but a Catechumen,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that but recently. She then was startled with a holy fear and</p>
<p class="calibre1">trembling; and though I was not as yet baptised, feared for me those</p>
<p class="calibre1">crooked ways in which they walk who turn their back to Thee, and not</p>
<p class="calibre1">their face.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woe is me! and dare I say that Thou heldest Thy peace, O my God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">while I wandered further from Thee? Didst Thou then indeed hold Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">peace to me? And whose but Thine were these words which by my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother, Thy faithful one, Thou sangest in my ears? Nothing whereof</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunk into my heart, so as to do it. For she wished, and I remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">in private with great anxiety warned me, “not to commit fornication;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but especially never to defile another man’s wife.” These seemed to me</p>
<p class="calibre1">womanish advices, which I should blush to obey. But they were Thine,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I knew it not: and I thought Thou wert silent and that it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">she who spake; by whom Thou wert not silent unto me; and in her wast</p>
<p class="calibre1">despised by me, her son, the son of Thy handmaid, Thy servant. But I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew it not; and ran headlong with such blindness, that amongst my</p>
<p class="calibre1">equals I was ashamed of a less shamelessness, when I heard them</p>
<p class="calibre1">boast of their flagitiousness, yea, and the more boasting, the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">they were degraded: and I took pleasure, not only in the pleasure of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the deed, but in the praise. What is worthy of dispraise but vice? But</p>
<p class="calibre1">I made myself worse than I was, that I might not be dispraised; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">when in any thing I had not sinned as the abandoned ones, I would</p>
<p class="calibre1">say that I had done what I had not done, that I might not seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemptible in proportion as I was innocent; or of less account,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the more chaste.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold with what companions I walked the streets of Babylon, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wallowed in the mire thereof, as if in a bed of spices and precious</p>
<p class="calibre1">ointments. And that I might cleave the faster to its very centre,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the invisible enemy trod me down, and seduced me, for that I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">easy to be seduced. Neither did the mother of my flesh (who had now</p>
<p class="calibre1">fled out of the centre of Babylon, yet went more slowly in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skirts thereof as she advised me to chastity, so heed what she had</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard of me from her husband, as to restrain within the bounds of</p>
<p class="calibre1">conjugal affection (if it could not be pared away to the quick) what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she felt to be pestilent at present and for the future dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She heeded not this, for she feared lest a wife should prove a clog</p>
<p class="calibre1">and hindrance to my hopes. Not those hopes of the world to come, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">my mother reposed in Thee; but the hope of learning, which both my</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents were too desirous I should attain; my father, because he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">next to no thought of Thee, and of me but vain conceits; my mother,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because she accounted that those usual courses of learning would not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only be no hindrance, but even some furtherance towards attaining</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. For thus I conjecture, recalling, as well as I may, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disposition of my parents. The reins, meantime, were slackened to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, beyond all temper of due severity, to spend my time in sport, yea,</p>
<p class="calibre1">even unto dissoluteness in whatsoever I affected. And in all was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mist, intercepting from me, O my God, the brightness of Thy truth; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine iniquity burst out as from very fatness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theft is punished by Thy law, O Lord, and the law written in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearts of men, which iniquity itself effaces not. For what thief</p>
<p class="calibre1">will abide a thief? not even a rich thief, one stealing through</p>
<p class="calibre1">want. Yet I lusted to thieve, and did it, compelled by no hunger,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor poverty, but through a cloyedness of well-doing, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pamperedness of iniquity. For I stole that, of which I had enough, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">much better. Nor cared I to enjoy what I stole, but joyed in the theft</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sin itself. A pear tree there was near our vineyard, laden with</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruit, tempting neither for colour nor taste. To shake and rob this,</p>
<p class="calibre1">some lewd young fellows of us went, late one night (having according</p>
<p class="calibre1">to our pestilent custom prolonged our sports in the streets till</p>
<p class="calibre1">then), and took huge loads, not for our eating, but to fling to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">very hogs, having only tasted them. And this, but to do what we</p>
<p class="calibre1">liked only, because it was misliked. Behold my heart, O God, behold my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, which Thou hadst pity upon in the bottom of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, behold, let my heart tell Thee what it sought there, that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be gratuitously evil, having no temptation to ill, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ill itself. It was foul, and I loved it; I loved to perish, I loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine own fault, not that for which I was faulty, but my fault</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself. Foul soul, falling from Thy firmament to utter destruction;</p>
<p class="calibre1">not seeking aught through the shame, but the shame itself!</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For there is an attractiveness in beautiful bodies, in gold and</p>
<p class="calibre1">silver, and all things; and in bodily touch, sympathy hath much</p>
<p class="calibre1">influence, and each other sense hath his proper object answerably</p>
<p class="calibre1">tempered. Wordly honour hath also its grace, and the power of</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcoming, and of mastery; whence springs also the thirst of revenge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But yet, to obtain all these, we may not depart from Thee, O Lord, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">decline from Thy law. The life also which here we live hath its own</p>
<p class="calibre1">enchantment, through a certain proportion of its own, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">correspondence with all things beautiful here below. Human</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendship also is endeared with a sweet tie, by reason of the unity</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed of many souls. Upon occasion of all these, and the like, is sin</p>
<p class="calibre1">committed, while through an immoderate inclination towards these goods</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the lowest order, the better and higher are forsaken,- Thou, our</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord God, Thy truth, and Thy law. For these lower things have their</p>
<p class="calibre1">delights, but not like my God, who made all things; for in Him doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">the righteous delight, and He is the joy of the upright in heart.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">When, then, we ask why a crime was done, we believe it not, unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">it appear that there might have been some desire of obtaining some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of those which we called lower goods, or a fear of losing them. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">they are beautiful and comely; although compared with those higher and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beatific goods, they be abject and low. A man hath murdered another;</p>
<p class="calibre1">why? he loved his wife or his estate; or would rob for his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">livelihood; or feared to lose some such things by him; or, wronged,</p>
<p class="calibre1">was on fire to be revenged. Would any commit murder upon no cause,</p>
<p class="calibre1">delighted simply in murdering? who would believe it? for as for that</p>
<p class="calibre1">furious and savage man, of whom it is said that he was gratuitously</p>
<p class="calibre1">evil and cruel, yet is the cause assigned; “lest” (saith he)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“through idleness hand or heart should grow inactive.” And to what</p>
<p class="calibre1">end? that, through that practice of guilt, he might, having taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">the city, attain to honours, empire, riches, and be freed from fear of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the laws, and his embarrassments from domestic needs, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness of villainies. So then, not even Catiline himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved his own villainies, but something else, for whose sake he did</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then did wretched I so love in thee, thou theft of mine, thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">deed of darkness, in that sixteenth year of my age? Lovely thou wert</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, because thou wert theft. But art thou any thing, that thus I</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak to thee? Fair were the pears we stole, because they were Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">creation, Thou fairest of all, Creator of all, Thou good God; God, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereign good and my true good. Fair were those pears, but not them</p>
<p class="calibre1">did my wretched soul desire; for I had store of better, and those I</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathered, only that I might steal. For, when gathered, I flung them</p>
<p class="calibre1">away, my only feast therein being my own sin, which I was pleased to</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoy. For if aught of those pears came within my mouth, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweetened it was the sin. And now, O Lord my God, I enquire what in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that theft delighted me; and behold it hath no loveliness; I mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">not such loveliness as in justice and wisdom; nor such as is in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind and memory, and senses, and animal life of man; nor yet as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stars are glorious and beautiful in their orbs; or the earth, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea, full of embryo-life, replacing by its birth that which</p>
<p class="calibre1">decayeth; nay, nor even that false and shadowy beauty which</p>
<p class="calibre1">belongeth to deceiving vices.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For so doth pride imitate exaltedness; whereas Thou alone art God</p>
<p class="calibre1">exalted over all. Ambition, what seeks it, but honours and glory?</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereas Thou alone art to be honoured above all, and glorious for</p>
<p class="calibre1">evermore. The cruelty of the great would fain be feared; but who is to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be feared but God alone, out of whose power what can be wrested or</p>
<p class="calibre1">withdrawn? when, or where, or whither, or by whom? The tendernesses of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the wanton would fain be counted love: yet is nothing more tender than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy charity; nor is aught loved more healthfully than that Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth, bright and beautiful above all. Curiosity makes semblance of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a desire of knowledge; whereas Thou supremely knowest all. Yea,</p>
<p class="calibre1">ignorance and foolishness itself is cloaked under the name of</p>
<p class="calibre1">simplicity and uninjuriousness; because nothing is found more single</p>
<p class="calibre1">than Thee: and what less injurious, since they are his own works which</p>
<p class="calibre1">injure the sinner? Yea, sloth would fain be at rest; but what stable</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest besides the Lord? Luxury affects to be called plenty and</p>
<p class="calibre1">abundance; but Thou art the fulness and never-failing plenteousness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">incorruptible pleasures. Prodigality presents a shadow of</p>
<p class="calibre1">liberality: but Thou art the most overflowing Giver of all good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Covetousness would possess many things; and Thou possessest all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things. Envy disputes for excellency: what more excellent than Thou?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anger seeks revenge: who revenges more justly than Thou? Fear startles</p>
<p class="calibre1">at things unwonted and sudden, which endangers things beloved, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes forethought for their safety; but to Thee what unwonted or</p>
<p class="calibre1">sudden, or who separateth from Thee what Thou lovest? Or where but</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Thee is unshaken safety? Grief pines away for things lost, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">delight of its desires; because it would have nothing taken from it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as nothing can from Thee.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus doth the soul commit fornication, when she turns from Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeking without Thee, what she findeth not pure and untainted, till</p>
<p class="calibre1">she returns to Thee. Thus all pervertedly imitate Thee, who remove far</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Thee, and lift themselves up against Thee. But even by thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">imitating Thee, they imply Thee to be the Creator of all nature;</p>
<p class="calibre1">whence there is no place whither altogether to retire from Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What then did I love in that theft? and wherein did I even corruptly</p>
<p class="calibre1">and pervertedly imitate my Lord? Did I wish even by stealth to do</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrary to Thy law, because by power I could not, so that being a</p>
<p class="calibre1">prisoner, I might mimic a maimed liberty by doing with impunity things</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpermitted me, a darkened likeness of Thy Omnipotency? Behold, Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servant, fleeing from his Lord, and obtaining a shadow. O</p>
<p class="calibre1">rottenness, O monstrousness of life, and depth of death! could I</p>
<p class="calibre1">like what I might not, only because I might not?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What shall I render unto the Lord, that, whilst my memory recalls</p>
<p class="calibre1">these things, my soul is not affrighted at them? I will love Thee, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, and thank Thee, and confess unto Thy name; because Thou hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgiven me these so great and heinous deeds of mine. To Thy grace I</p>
<p class="calibre1">ascribe it, and to Thy mercy, that Thou hast melted away my sins as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were ice. To Thy grace I ascribe also whatsoever I have not done of</p>
<p class="calibre1">evil; for what might I not have done, who even loved a sin for its own</p>
<p class="calibre1">sake? Yea, all I confess to have been forgiven me; both what evils I</p>
<p class="calibre1">committed by my own wilfulness, and what by Thy guidance I committed</p>
<p class="calibre1">not. What man is he, who, weighing his own infirmity, dares to ascribe</p>
<p class="calibre1">his purity and innocency to his own strength; that so he should love</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee the less, as if he had less needed Thy mercy, whereby Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">remittest sins to those that turn to Thee? For whosoever, called by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, followed Thy voice, and avoided those things which he reads me</p>
<p class="calibre1">recalling and confessing of myself, let him not scorn me, who being</p>
<p class="calibre1">sick, was cured by that Physician, through whose aid it was that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not, or rather was less, sick: and for this let him love Thee as</p>
<p class="calibre1">much, yea and more; since by whom he sees me to have been recovered</p>
<p class="calibre1">from such deep consumption of sin, by Him he sees himself to have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the like consumption of sin preserved.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What fruit had I then (wretched man!) in those things, of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembrance whereof I am now ashamed? Especially, in that theft</p>
<p class="calibre1">which I loved for the theft’s sake; and it too was nothing, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore the more miserable I, who loved it. Yet alone I had not done</p>
<p class="calibre1">it: such was I then, I remember, alone I had never done it. I loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">then in it also the company of the accomplices, with whom I did it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">I did not then love nothing else but the theft, yea rather I did</p>
<p class="calibre1">love nothing else; for that circumstance of the company was also</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing. What is, in truth? who can teach me, save He that</p>
<p class="calibre1">enlighteneth my heart, and discovereth its dark corners? What is it</p>
<p class="calibre1">which hath come into my mind to enquire, and discuss, and consider?</p>
<p class="calibre1">For had I then loved the pears I stole, and wished to enjoy them, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might have done it alone, had the bare commission of the theft</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficed to attain my pleasure; nor needed I have inflamed the itching</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my desires by the excitement of accomplices. But since my</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure was not in those pears, it was in the offence itself, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">the company of fellow-sinners occasioned.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then was this feeling? For of a truth it was too foul: and</p>
<p class="calibre1">woe was me, who had it. But yet what was it? Who can understand his</p>
<p class="calibre1">errors? It was the sport, which as it were tickled our hearts, that we</p>
<p class="calibre1">beguiled those who little thought what we were doing, and much</p>
<p class="calibre1">disliked it. Why then was my delight of such sort that I did it not</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone? Because none doth ordinarily laugh alone? ordinarily no one;</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet laughter sometimes masters men alone and singly when on one</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever is with them, if anything very ludicrous presents itself to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their senses or mind. Yet I had not done this alone; alone I had never</p>
<p class="calibre1">done it. Behold my God, before Thee, the vivid remembrance of my soul;</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone, I had never committed that theft wherein what I stole pleased</p>
<p class="calibre1">me not, but that I stole; nor had it alone liked me to do it, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">had I done it. O friendship too unfriendly! thou incomprehensible</p>
<p class="calibre1">inveigler of the soul, thou greediness to do mischief out of mirth and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wantonness, thou thirst of others’ loss, without lust of my own gain</p>
<p class="calibre1">or revenge: but when it is said, “Let’s go, let’s do it,” we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">ashamed not to be shameless.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who can disentangle that twisted and intricate knottiness? Foul is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it: I hate to think on it, to look on it. But Thee I long for, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Righteousness and Innocency, beautiful and comely to all pure eyes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and of a satisfaction unsating. With Thee is rest entire, and life</p>
<p class="calibre1">imperturbable. Whoso enters into Thee, enters into the joy of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord: and shall not fear, and shall do excellently in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">All-Excellent. I sank away from Thee, and I wandered, O my God, too</p>
<p class="calibre1">much astray from Thee my stay, in these days of my youth, and I became</p>
<p class="calibre1">to myself a barren land.</p>
