<h2 id="calibre_toc_7" class="calibre7">BOOK VI</h2><p class="calibre1">O Thou, my hope from my youth, where wert Thou to me, and whither</p>
<p class="calibre1">wert Thou gone? Hadst not Thou created me, and separated me from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beasts of the field, and fowls of the air? Thou hadst made me wiser,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet did I walk in darkness, and in slippery places, and sought Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">abroad out of myself, and found not the God of my heart; and had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come into the depths of the sea, and distrusted and despaired of</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever finding truth. My mother had now come to me, resolute through</p>
<p class="calibre1">piety, following me over sea and land, in all perils confiding in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. For in perils of the sea, she comforted the very mariners (by</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom passengers unacquainted with the deep, use rather to be comforted</p>
<p class="calibre1">when troubled), assuring them of a safe arrival, because Thou hadst by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a vision assured her thereof. She found me in grievous peril,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through despair of ever finding truth. But when I had discovered to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her that I was now no longer a Manichee, though not yet a Catholic</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian, she was not overjoyed, as at something unexpected; although</p>
<p class="calibre1">she was now assured concerning that part of my misery, for which she</p>
<p class="calibre1">bewailed me as one dead, though to be reawakened by Thee, carrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">me forth upon the bier of her thoughts, that Thou mightest say to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the son of the widow, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise; and he should</p>
<p class="calibre1">revive, and begin to speak, and Thou shouldest deliver him to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother. Her heart then was shaken with no tumultuous exultation,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when she heard that what she daily with tears desired of Thee was</p>
<p class="calibre1">already in so great part realised; in that, though I had not yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">attained the truth, I was rescued from falsehood; but, as being</p>
<p class="calibre1">assured, that Thou, Who hadst promised the whole, wouldest one day</p>
<p class="calibre1">give the rest, most calmly, and with a heart full of confidence, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">replied to me, “She believed in Christ, that before she departed</p>
<p class="calibre1">this life, she should see me a Catholic believer.” Thus much to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But to Thee, Fountain of mercies, poured she forth more copious</p>
<p class="calibre1">prayers and tears, that Thou wouldest hasten Thy help, and enlighten</p>
<p class="calibre1">my darkness; and she hastened the more eagerly to the Church, and hung</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the lips of Ambrose, praying for the fountain of that water,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which springeth up unto life everlasting. But that man she loved as an</p>
<p class="calibre1">angel of God, because she knew that by him I had been brought for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the present to that doubtful state of faith I now was in, through</p>
<p class="calibre1">which she anticipated most confidently that I should pass from</p>
<p class="calibre1">sickness unto health, after the access, as it were, of a sharper</p>
<p class="calibre1">fit, which physicians call “the crisis.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">When then my mother had once, as she was wont in Afric, brought to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Churches built in memory of the Saints, certain cakes, and bread</p>
<p class="calibre1">and wine, and was forbidden by the door-keeper; so soon as she knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the Bishop had forbidden this, she so piously and obediently</p>
<p class="calibre1">embraced his wishes, that I myself wondered how readily she censured</p>
<p class="calibre1">her own practice, rather than discuss his prohibition. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">wine-bibbing did not lay siege to her spirit, nor did love of wine</p>
<p class="calibre1">provoke her to hatred of the truth, as it doth too many (both men</p>
<p class="calibre1">and women), who revolt at a lesson of sobriety, as men well-drunk at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">draught mingled with water. But she, when she had brought her basket</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the accustomed festival-food, to be but tasted by herself, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then given away, never joined therewith more than one small cup of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wine, diluted according to her own abstemious habits, which for</p>
<p class="calibre1">courtesy she would taste. And if there were many churches of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">departed saints that were to be honoured in that manner, she still</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried round that same one cup, to be used every where; and this,</p>
<p class="calibre1">though not only made very watery, but unpleasantly heated with</p>
<p class="calibre1">carrying about, she would distribute to those about her by small sips;</p>
<p class="calibre1">for she sought there devotion, not pleasure. So soon, then, as she</p>
<p class="calibre1">found this custom to be forbidden by that famous preacher and most</p>
<p class="calibre1">pious prelate, even to those that would use it soberly, lest so an</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasion of excess might be given to the drunken; and for these, as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were, anniversary funeral solemnities did much resemble the</p>
<p class="calibre1">superstition of the Gentiles, she most willingly forbare it: and for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">basket filled with fruits of the earth, she had learned to bring to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Churches of the martyrs a breast filled with more purified</p>
<p class="calibre1">petitions, and to give what she could to the poor; that so the</p>
<p class="calibre1">communication of the Lord’s Body might be there rightly celebrated,</p>
<p class="calibre1">where, after the example of His Passion, the martyrs had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrificed and crowned. But yet it seems to me, O Lord my God, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thus thinks my heart of it in Thy sight, that perhaps she would not so</p>
<p class="calibre1">readily have yielded to the cutting off of this custom, had it been</p>
<p class="calibre1">forbidden by another, whom she loved not as Ambrose, whom, for my</p>
<p class="calibre1">salvation, she loved most entirely; and he her again, for her most</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious conversation, whereby in good works, so fervent in spirit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she was constant at church; so that, when he saw me, he often burst</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth into her praises; congratulating me that I had such a mother;</p>
<p class="calibre1">not knowing what a son she had in me, who doubted of all these things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and imagined the way to life could not be found out.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor did I yet groan in my prayers, that Thou wouldest help me; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">my spirit was wholly intent on learning, and restless to dispute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And Ambrose himself, as the world counts happy, I esteemed a happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">man, whom personages so great held in such honour; only his celibacy</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed to me a painful course. But what hope he bore within him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">what struggles he had against the temptations which beset his very</p>
<p class="calibre1">excellencies, or what comfort in adversities, and what sweet joys</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy Bread had for the hidden mouth of his spirit, when chewing the cud</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereof, I neither could conjecture, nor had experienced. Nor did he</p>
<p class="calibre1">know the tides of my feelings, or the abyss of my danger. For I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could not ask of him, what I would as I would, being shut out both</p>
<p class="calibre1">from his ear and speech by multitudes of busy people, whose weaknesses</p>
<p class="calibre1">he served. With whom when he was not taken up (which was but a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little time), he was either refreshing his body with the sustenance</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely necessary, or his mind with reading. But when he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading, his eye glided over the pages, and his heart searched out the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense, but his voice and tongue were at rest. Ofttimes when we had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come (for no man was forbidden to enter, nor was it his wont that</p>
<p class="calibre1">any who came should be announced to him), we saw him thus reading to</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself, and never otherwise; and having long sat silent (for who</p>
<p class="calibre1">durst intrude on one so intent?) we were fain to depart,</p>
<p class="calibre1">conjecturing that in the small interval which he obtained, free from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the din of others’ business, for the recruiting of his mind, he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">loth to be taken off; and perchance he dreaded lest if the author he</p>
<p class="calibre1">read should deliver any thing obscurely, some attentive or perplexed</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearer should desire him to expound it, or to discuss some of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">harder questions; so that his time being thus spent, he could not turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">over so many volumes as he desired; although the preserving of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice (which a very little speaking would weaken) might be the truer</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason for his reading to himself. But with what intent soever he</p>
<p class="calibre1">did it, certainly in such a man it was good.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I however certainly had no opportunity of enquiring what I wished of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that so holy oracle of Thine, his breast, unless the thing might be</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered briefly. But those tides in me, to be poured out to him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">required his full leisure, and never found it. I heard him indeed</p>
<p class="calibre1">every Lord’s day, rightly expounding the Word of truth among the</p>
<p class="calibre1">people; and I was more and more convinced that all the knots of</p>
<p class="calibre1">those crafty calumnies, which those our deceivers had knit against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Divine Books, could be unravelled. But when I understood withal,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that “man created by Thee, after Thine own image,” was not so</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood by Thy spiritual sons, whom of the Catholic Mother Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast born again through grace, as though they believed and conceived</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thee as bounded by human shape (although what a spiritual substance</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be I had not even a faint or shadowy notion); yet, with joy I</p>
<p class="calibre1">blushed at having so many years barked not against the Catholic faith,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but against the fictions of carnal imaginations. For so rash and</p>
<p class="calibre1">impious had I been, that what I ought by enquiring to have learned,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had pronounced on, condemning. For Thou, Most High, and most near;</p>
<p class="calibre1">most secret, and most present; Who hast not limbs some larger, some</p>
<p class="calibre1">smaller, but art wholly every where, and no where in space, art not of</p>
<p class="calibre1">such corporeal shape, yet hast Thou made man after Thine own image;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and behold, from head to foot is he contained in space.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignorant then how this Thy image should subsist, I should have</p>
<p class="calibre1">knocked and proposed the doubt, how it was to be believed, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">insultingly opposed it, as if believed. Doubt, then, what to hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">for certain, the more sharply gnawed my heart, the more ashamed I was,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that so long deluded and deceived by the promise of certainties, I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">with childish error and vehemence, prated of so many uncertainties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For that they were falsehoods became clear to me later. However I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was certain that they were uncertain, and that I had formerly</p>
<p class="calibre1">accounted them certain, when with a blind contentiousness, I accused</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy Catholic Church, whom I now discovered, not indeed as yet to teach</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly, but at least not to teach that for which I had grievously</p>
<p class="calibre1">censured her. So I was confounded, and converted: and I joyed, O my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, that the One Only Church, the body of Thine Only Son (wherein the</p>
<p class="calibre1">name of Christ had been put upon me as an infant), had no taste for</p>
<p class="calibre1">infantine conceits; nor in her sound doctrine maintained any tenet</p>
<p class="calibre1">which should confine Thee, the Creator of all, in space, however great</p>
<p class="calibre1">and large, yet bounded every where by the limits of a human form.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I joyed also that the old Scriptures of the law and the Prophets</p>
<p class="calibre1">were laid before me, not now to be perused with that eye to which</p>
<p class="calibre1">before they seemed absurd, when I reviled Thy holy ones for so</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking, whereas indeed they thought not so: and with joy I heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose in his sermons to the people, oftentimes most diligently</p>
<p class="calibre1">recommend this text for a rule, The letter killeth, but the Spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">giveth life; whilst he drew aside the mystic veil, laying open</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritually what, according to the letter, seemed to teach something</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsound; teaching herein nothing that offended me, though he taught</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I knew not as yet, whether it were true. For I kept my heart from</p>
<p class="calibre1">assenting to any thing, fearing to fall headlong; but by hanging in</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspense I was the worse killed. For I wished to be as assured of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the things I saw not, as I was that seven and three are ten. For I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not so mad as to think that even this could not be comprehended; but I</p>
<p class="calibre1">desired to have other things as clear as this, whether things</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporeal, which were not present to my senses, or spiritual,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereof I knew not how to conceive, except corporeally. And by</p>
<p class="calibre1">believing might I have been cured, that so the eyesight of my soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">being cleared, might in some way be directed to Thy truth, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">abideth always, and in no part faileth. But as it happens that one who</p>
<p class="calibre1">has tried a bad physician, fears to trust himself with a good one,</p>
<p class="calibre1">so was it with the health of my soul, which could not be healed but by</p>
<p class="calibre1">believing, and lest it should believe falsehoods, refused to be cured;</p>
<p class="calibre1">resisting Thy hands, Who hast prepared the medicines of faith, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast applied them to the diseases of the whole world, and given unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">them so great authority.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being led, however, from this to prefer the Catholic doctrine, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt that her proceeding was more unassuming and honest, in that she</p>
<p class="calibre1">required to be believed things not demonstrated (whether it was that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they could in themselves be demonstrated but not to certain persons,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or could not at all be), whereas among the Manichees our credulity was</p>
<p class="calibre1">mocked by a promise of certain knowledge, and then so many most</p>
<p class="calibre1">fabulous and absurd things were imposed to be believed, because they</p>
<p class="calibre1">could not be demonstrated. Then Thou, O Lord, little by little with</p>
<p class="calibre1">most tender and most merciful hand, touching and composing my heart,</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst persuade me-considering what innumerable things I believed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which I saw not, nor was present while they were done, as so many</p>
<p class="calibre1">things in secular history, so many reports of places and of cities,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which I had not seen; so many of friends, so many of physicians, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many continually of other men, which unless we should believe, we</p>
<p class="calibre1">should do nothing at all in this life; lastly, with how unshaken an</p>
<p class="calibre1">assurance I believed of what parents I was born, which I could not</p>
<p class="calibre1">know, had I not believed upon hearsay -considering all this, Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst persuade me, that not they who believed Thy Books (which Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast established in so great authority among almost all nations),</p>
<p class="calibre1">but they who believed them not, were to be blamed; and that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were not to be heard, who should say to me, “How knowest thou those</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scriptures to have been imparted unto mankind by the Spirit of the one</p>
<p class="calibre1">true and most true God?” For this very thing was of all most to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed, since no contentiousness of blasphemous questionings, of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that multitude which I had read in the self-contradicting</p>
<p class="calibre1">philosophers, could wring this belief from me, “That Thou art”</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever Thou wert (what I knew not), and “That the government of</p>
<p class="calibre1">human things belongs to Thee.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This I believed, sometimes more strongly, more weakly otherwhiles;</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet I ever believed both that Thou wert, and hadst a care of us;</p>
<p class="calibre1">though I was ignorant, both what was to be thought of Thy substance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and what way led or led back to Thee. Since then we were too weak by</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstract reasonings to find out truth: and for this very cause</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed the authority of Holy Writ; I had now begun to believe that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou wouldest never have given such excellency of authority to that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Writ in all lands, hadst Thou not willed thereby to be believed in,</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereby sought. For now what things, sounding strangely in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scripture, were wont to offend me, having heard divers of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">expounded satisfactorily, I referred to the depth of the mysteries,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and its authority appeared to me the more venerable, and more worthy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of religious credence, in that, while it lay open to all to read, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">reserved the majesty of its mysteries within its profounder meaning,</p>
<p class="calibre1">stooping to all in the great plainness of its words and lowliness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">its style, yet calling forth the intensest application of such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">are not light of heart; that so it might receive all in its open</p>
<p class="calibre1">bosom, and through narrow passages waft over towards Thee some few,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet many more than if it stood not aloft on such a height of</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority, nor drew multitudes within its bosom by its holy lowliness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These things I thought on, and Thou wert with me; I sighed, and Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">heardest me; I wavered, and Thou didst guide me; I wandered through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the broad way of the world, and Thou didst not forsake me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I panted after honours, gains, marriage; and thou deridedst me. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">these desires I underwent most bitter crosses, Thou being the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">gracious, the less Thou sufferedst aught to grow sweet to me, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not Thou. Behold my heart, O Lord, who wouldest I should</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember all this, and confess to Thee. Let my soul cleave unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, now that Thou hast freed it from that fast-holding birdlime of</p>
<p class="calibre1">death. How wretched was it! and Thou didst irritate the feeling of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">wound, that forsaking all else, it might be converted unto Thee, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">art above all, and without whom all things would be nothing; be</p>
<p class="calibre1">converted, and be healed. How miserable was I then, and how didst Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal with me, to make me feel my misery on that day, when I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">preparing to recite a panegyric of the Emperor, wherein I was to utter</p>
<p class="calibre1">many a lie, and lying, was to be applauded by those who knew I lied,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and my heart was panting with these anxieties, and boiling with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">feverishness of consuming thoughts. For, passing through one of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">streets of Milan, I observed a poor beggar, then, I suppose, with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">full belly, joking and joyous: and I sighed, and spoke to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends around me, of the many sorrows of our frenzies; for that by</p>
<p class="calibre1">all such efforts of ours, as those wherein I then toiled dragging</p>
<p class="calibre1">along, under the goading of desire, the burthen of my own</p>
<p class="calibre1">wretchedness, and, by dragging, augmenting it, we yet looked to arrive</p>
<p class="calibre1">only at that very joyousness whither that beggar-man had arrived</p>
<p class="calibre1">before us, who should never perchance attain it. For what he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained by means of a few begged pence, the same was I plotting for</p>
<p class="calibre1">by many a toilsome turning and winding; the joy of a temporary</p>
<p class="calibre1">felicity. For he verily had not the true joy; but yet I with those</p>
<p class="calibre1">my ambitious designs was seeking one much less true. And certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was joyous, I anxious; he void of care, I full of fears. But should</p>
<p class="calibre1">any ask me, had I rather be merry or fearful? I would answer merry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, if he asked had I rather be such as he was, or what I then was?</p>
<p class="calibre1">I should choose to be myself, though worn with cares and fears; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of wrong judgment; for, was it the truth? For I ought not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prefer myself to him, because more learned than he, seeing I had no</p>
<p class="calibre1">joy therein, but sought to please men by it; and that not to instruct,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but simply to please. Wherefore also Thou didst break my bones with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the staff of Thy correction.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Away with those then from my soul who say to her, “It makes a</p>
<p class="calibre1">difference whence a man’s joy is. That beggar-man joyed in</p>
<p class="calibre1">drunkenness; Thou desiredst to joy in glory.” What glory, Lord? That</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is not in Thee. For even as his was no true joy, so was that</p>
<p class="calibre1">no true glory: and it overthrew my soul more. He that very night</p>
<p class="calibre1">should digest his drunkenness; but I had slept and risen again with</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine, and was to sleep again, and again to rise with it, how many</p>
<p class="calibre1">days, Thou, God, knowest. But “it doth make a difference whence a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man’s joy is.” I know it, and the joy of a faithful hope lieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomparably beyond such vanity. Yea, and so was he then beyond me:</p>
<p class="calibre1">for he verily was the happier; not only for that he was thoroughly</p>
<p class="calibre1">drenched in mirth, I disembowelled with cares: but he, by fair wishes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">had gotten wine; I, by lying, was seeking for empty, swelling</p>
<p class="calibre1">praise. Much to this purpose said I then to my friends: and I often</p>
<p class="calibre1">marked in them how it fared with me; and I found it went ill with</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, and grieved, and doubled that very ill; and if any prosperity</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiled on me, I was loth to catch at it, for almost before I could</p>
<p class="calibre1">grasp it, it flew away.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">These things we, who were living as friends together, bemoaned</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, but chiefly and most familiarly did I speak thereof with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alypius and Nebridius, of whom Alypius was born in the same town</p>
<p class="calibre1">with me, of persons of chief rank there, but younger than I. For he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had studied under me, both when I first lectured in our town, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">afterwards at Carthage, and he loved me much, because I seemed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him kind, and learned; and I him, for his great towardliness to</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtue, which was eminent enough in one of no greater years. Yet the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whirlpool of Carthaginian habits (amongst whom those idle spectacles</p>
<p class="calibre1">are hotly followed) had drawn him into the madness of the Circus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But while he was miserably tossed therein, and I, professing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rhetoric there, had a public school, as yet he used not my teaching,</p>
<p class="calibre1">by reason of some unkindness risen betwixt his father and me. I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">found then how deadly he doted upon the Circus, and was deeply grieved</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he seemed likely, nay, or had thrown away so great promise: yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">had I no means of advising or with a sort of constraint reclaiming</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, either by the kindness of a friend, or the authority of a master.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For I supposed that he thought of me as did his father; but he was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">such; laying aside then his father’s mind in that matter, he began</p>
<p class="calibre1">to greet me, come sometimes into my lecture room, hear a little, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">be gone.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I however had forgotten to deal with him, that he should not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through a blind and headlong desire of vain pastimes, undo so good a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wit. But Thou, O Lord, who guidest the course of all Thou hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">created, hadst not forgotten him, who was one day to be among Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">children, Priest and Dispenser of Thy Sacrament; and that his</p>
<p class="calibre1">amendment might plainly be attributed to Thyself, Thou effectedst it</p>
<p class="calibre1">through me, unknowingly. For as one day I sat in my accustomed</p>
<p class="calibre1">place, with my scholars before me, he entered, greeted me, sat down,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and applied his mind to what I then handled. I had by chance a passage</p>
<p class="calibre1">in hand, which while I was explaining, a likeness from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Circensian races occurred to me, as likely to make what I would convey</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasanter and plainer, seasoned with biting mockery of those whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">that madness had enthralled; God, Thou knowest that I then thought not</p>
<p class="calibre1">of curing Alypius of that infection. But he took it wholly to himself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and thought that I said it simply for his sake. And whence another</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have taken occasion of offence with me, that right-minded</p>
<p class="calibre1">youth took as a ground of being offended at himself, and loving me</p>
<p class="calibre1">more fervently. For Thou hadst said it long ago, and put it into Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">book, Rebuke a wise man and he will love Thee. But I had not rebuked</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, but Thou, who employest all, knowing or not knowing, in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">order which Thyself knowest (and that order is just), didst of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart and tongue make burning coals, by which to set on fire the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopeful mind, thus languishing, and so cure it. Let him be silent in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy praises, who considers not Thy mercies, which confess unto Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of my inmost soul. For he upon that speech burst out of that pit</p>
<p class="calibre1">so deep, wherein he was wilfully plunged, and was blinded with its</p>
<p class="calibre1">wretched pastimes; and he shook his mind with a strong self-command;</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereupon all the filths of the Circensian pastimes flew off from him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor came he again thither. Upon this, he prevailed with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwilling father that he might be my scholar. He gave way, and gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">in. And Alypius beginning to be my hearer again, was involved in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same superstition with me, loving in the Manichees that show of</p>
<p class="calibre1">continency which he supposed true and unfeigned. Whereas it was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">senseless and seducing continency, ensnaring precious souls, unable as</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet to reach the depth of virtue, yet readily beguiled with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surface of what was but a shadowy and counterfeit virtue.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He, not forsaking that secular course which his parents had</p>
<p class="calibre1">charmed him to pursue, had gone before me to Rome, to study law, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there he was carried away incredibly with an incredible eagerness</p>
<p class="calibre1">after the shows of gladiators. For being utterly averse to and</p>
<p class="calibre1">detesting spectacles, he was one day by chance met by divers of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquaintance and fellow-students coming from dinner, and they with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">familiar violence haled him, vehemently refusing and resisting, into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Amphitheatre, during these cruel and deadly shows, he thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">protesting: “Though you hale my body to that place, and there set</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, can you force me also to turn my mind or my eyes to those shows? I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall then be absent while present, and so shall overcome both you and</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.” They, hearing this, led him on nevertheless, desirous perchance</p>
<p class="calibre1">to try that very thing, whether he could do as he said. When they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">come thither, and had taken their places as they could, the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">place kindled with that savage pastime. But he, closing the passage of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his eyes, forbade his mind to range abroad after such evil; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">would he had stopped his ears also! For in the fight, when one fell, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mighty cry of the whole people striking him strongly, overcome by</p>
<p class="calibre1">curiosity, and as if prepared to despise and be superior to it</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever it were, even when seen, he opened his eyes, and was</p>
<p class="calibre1">stricken with a deeper wound in his soul than the other, whom he</p>
<p class="calibre1">desired to behold, was in his body; and he fell more miserably than he</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon whose fall that mighty noise was raised, which entered through</p>
<p class="calibre1">his ears, and unlocked his eyes, to make way for the striking and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beating down of a soul, bold rather than resolute, and the weaker,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that it had presumed on itself, which ought to have relied on Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For so soon as he saw that blood, he therewith drunk down</p>
<p class="calibre1">savageness; nor turned away, but fixed his eye, drinking in frenzy,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unawares, and was delighted with that guilty fight, and intoxicated</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the bloody pastime. Nor was he now the man he came, but one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the throng he came unto, yea, a true associate of theirs that</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought him thither. Why say more? He beheld, shouted, kindled,</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried thence with him the madness which should goad him to return</p>
<p class="calibre1">not only with them who first drew him thither, but also before them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yea and to draw in others. Yet thence didst Thou with a most strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">and most merciful hand pluck him, and taughtest him to have confidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">not in himself, but in Thee. But this was after.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this was already being laid up in his memory to be a medicine</p>
<p class="calibre1">hereafter. So was that also, that when he was yet studying under me at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carthage, and was thinking over at mid-day in the marketplace what he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was to say by heart (as scholars use to practise), Thou sufferedst him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be apprehended by the officers of the marketplace for a thief. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">no other cause, I deem, didst Thou, our God, suffer it, but that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">who was hereafter to prove so great a man, should already begin to</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn that in judging of causes, man was not readily to be condemned</p>
<p class="calibre1">by man out of a rash credulity. For as he was walking up and down by</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself before the judgment-seat, with his note-book and pen, lo, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">young man, a lawyer, the real thief, privily bringing a hatchet, got</p>
<p class="calibre1">in, unperceived by Alypius, as far as the leaden gratings which</p>
<p class="calibre1">fence in the silversmiths’ shops, and began to cut away the lead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the noise of the hatchet being heard, the silversmiths beneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">began to make a stir, and sent to apprehend whomever they should find.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But he, hearing their voices, ran away, leaving his hatchet, fearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be taken with it. Alypius now, who had not seen him enter, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware of his going, and saw with what speed he made away. And being</p>
<p class="calibre1">desirous to know the matter, entered the place; where finding the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hatchet, he was standing, wondering and considering it, when behold,</p>
<p class="calibre1">those that had been sent, find him alone with the hatchet in his hand,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the noise whereof had startled and brought them thither. They seize</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, hale him away, and gathering the dwellers in the marketplace</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, boast of having taken a notorious thief, and so he was being</p>
<p class="calibre1">led away to be taken before the judge.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But thus far was Alypius to be instructed. For forthwith, O Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou succouredst his innocency, whereof Thou alone wert witness. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">as he was being led either to prison or to punishment, a certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">architect met them, who had the chief charge of the public</p>
<p class="calibre1">buildings. Glad they were to meet him especially, by whom they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">wont to be suspected of stealing the goods lost out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">marketplace, as though to show him at last by whom these thefts were</p>
<p class="calibre1">committed. He, however, had divers times seen Alypius at a certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">senator’s house, to whom he often went to pay his respects; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognising him immediately, took him aside by the hand, and enquiring</p>
<p class="calibre1">the occasion of so great a calamity, heard the whole matter, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bade all present, amid much uproar and threats, to go with him. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">they came to the house of the young man who had done the deed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There, before the door, was a boy so young as to be likely, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">apprehending any harm to his master, to disclose the whole. For he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">attended his master to the marketplace. Whom so soon as Alypius</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered, he told the architect: and he showing the hatchet to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy, asked him “Whose that was?” “Ours,” quoth he presently: and being</p>
<p class="calibre1">further questioned, he discovered every thing. Thus the crime being</p>
<p class="calibre1">transferred to that house, and the multitude ashamed, which had</p>
<p class="calibre1">begun to insult over Alypius, he who was to be a dispenser of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Word, and an examiner of many causes in Thy Church, went away better</p>
<p class="calibre1">experienced and instructed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Him then I had found at Rome, and he clave to me by a most strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">tie, and went with me to Milan, both that he might not leave me, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">might practise something of the law he had studied, more to please his</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents than himself. There he had thrice sat as Assessor, with an</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncorruptness much wondered at by others, he wondering at others</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather who could prefer gold to honesty. His character was tried</p>
<p class="calibre1">besides, not only with the bait of covetousness, but with the goad</p>
<p class="calibre1">of fear. At Rome he was Assessor to the count of the Italian Treasury.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was at that time a very powerful senator, to whose favours</p>
<p class="calibre1">many stood indebted, many much feared. He would needs, by his usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">power, have a thing allowed him which by the laws was unallowed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alypius resisted it: a bribe was promised; with all his heart he</p>
<p class="calibre1">scorned it: threats were held out; he trampled upon them: all</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondering at so unwonted a spirit, which neither desired the</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendship, nor feared the enmity of one so great and so mightily</p>
<p class="calibre1">renowned for innumerable means of doing good or evil. And the very</p>
<p class="calibre1">judge, whose councillor Alypius was, although also unwilling it should</p>
<p class="calibre1">be, yet did not openly refuse, but put the matter off upon Alypius,</p>
<p class="calibre1">alleging that he would not allow him to do it: for in truth had the</p>
<p class="calibre1">judge done it, Alypius would have decided otherwise. With this one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing in the way of learning was he well-nigh seduced, that he might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have books copied for him at Praetorian prices, but consulting</p>
<p class="calibre1">justice, he altered his deliberation for the better; esteeming</p>
<p class="calibre1">equity whereby he was hindered more gainful than the power whereby</p>
<p class="calibre1">he were allowed. These are slight things, but he that is faithful in</p>
<p class="calibre1">little, is faithful also in much. Nor can that any how be void,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which proceeded out of the mouth of Thy Truth: If ye have not been</p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your trust true</p>
<p class="calibre1">riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another</p>
<p class="calibre1">man’s, who shall give you that which is your own? He being such, did</p>
<p class="calibre1">at that time cleave to me, and with me wavered in purpose, what course</p>
<p class="calibre1">of life was to be taken.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nebridius also, who having left his native country near Carthage,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yea and Carthage itself, where he had much lived, leaving his</p>
<p class="calibre1">excellent family-estate and house, and a mother behind, who was not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow him, had come to Milan, for no other reason but that with me he</p>
<p class="calibre1">might live in a most ardent search after truth and wisdom. Like me</p>
<p class="calibre1">he sighed, like me he wavered, an ardent searcher after true life, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a most acute examiner of the most difficult questions. Thus were there</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mouths of three indigent persons, sighing out their wants one to</p>
<p class="calibre1">another, and waiting upon Thee that Thou mightest give them their meat</p>
<p class="calibre1">in due season. And in all the bitterness which by Thy mercy followed</p>
<p class="calibre1">our worldly affairs, as we looked towards the end, why we should</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffer all this, darkness met us; and we turned away groaning, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying, How long shall these things be? This too we often said; and so</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying forsook them not, for as yet there dawned nothing certain,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which these forsaken, we might embrace.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I, viewing and reviewing things, most wondered at the length</p>
<p class="calibre1">of time from that my nineteenth year, wherein I had begun to kindle</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the desire of wisdom, settling when I had found her, to abandon</p>
<p class="calibre1">all the empty hopes and lying frenzies of vain desires. And lo, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was now in my thirtieth year, sticking in the same mire, greedy of</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoying things present, which passed away and wasted my soul; while I</p>
<p class="calibre1">said to myself, “Tomorrow I shall find it; it will appear manifestly</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I shall grasp it; to, Faustus the Manichee will come, and clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">every thing! O you great men, ye Academicians, it is true then, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">no certainty can be attained for the ordering of life! Nay, let us</p>
<p class="calibre1">search the more diligently, and despair not. Lo, things in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ecclesiastical books are not absurd to us now, which sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed absurd, and may be otherwise taken, and in a good sense. I will</p>
<p class="calibre1">take my stand, where, as a child, my parents placed me, until the</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear truth be found out. But where shall it be sought or when?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose has no leisure; we have no leisure to read; where shall we</p>
<p class="calibre1">find even the books? Whence, or when procure them? from whom borrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">them? Let set times be appointed, and certain hours be ordered for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">health of our soul. Great hope has dawned; the Catholic Faith</p>
<p class="calibre1">teaches not what we thought, and vainly accused it of; her</p>
<p class="calibre1">instructed members hold it profane to believe God to be bounded by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure of a human body: and do we doubt to ‘knock,’ that the rest ‘may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be opened’? The forenoons our scholars take up; what do we during</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rest? Why not this? But when then pay we court to our great</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends, whose favour we need? When compose what we may sell to</p>
<p class="calibre1">scholars? When refresh ourselves, unbending our minds from this</p>
<p class="calibre1">intenseness of care?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perish every thing, dismiss we these empty vanities, and betake</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves to the one search for truth! Life is vain, death</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncertain; if it steals upon us on a sudden, in what state shall we</p>
<p class="calibre1">depart hence? and where shall we learn what here we have neglected?</p>
<p class="calibre1">and shall we not rather suffer the punishment of this negligence?</p>
<p class="calibre1">What, if death itself cut off and end all care and feeling? Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">must this be ascertained. But God forbid this! It is no vain and empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, that the excellent dignity of the authority of the Christian</p>
<p class="calibre1">Faith hath overspread the whole world. Never would such and so great</p>
<p class="calibre1">things be by God wrought for us, if with the death of the body the</p>
<p class="calibre1">life of the soul came to an end. Wherefore delay then to abandon</p>
<p class="calibre1">worldly hopes, and give ourselves wholly to seek after God and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">blessed life? But wait! Even those things are pleasant; they have</p>
<p class="calibre1">some, and no small sweetness. We must not lightly abandon them, for it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were a shame to return again to them. See, it is no great matter now</p>
<p class="calibre1">to obtain some station, and then what should we more wish for? We have</p>
<p class="calibre1">store of powerful friends; if nothing else offer, and we be in much</p>
<p class="calibre1">haste, at least a presidentship may be given us: and a wife with</p>
<p class="calibre1">some money, that she increase not our charges: and this shall be the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bound of desire. Many great men, and most worthy of imitation, have</p>
<p class="calibre1">given themselves to the study of wisdom in the state of marriage.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">While I went over these things, and these winds shifted and drove my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart this way and that, time passed on, but I delayed to turn to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lord; and from day to day deferred to live in Thee, and deferred</p>
<p class="calibre1">not daily to die in myself. Loving a happy life, I feared it in its</p>
<p class="calibre1">own abode, and sought it, by fleeing from it. I thought I should be</p>
<p class="calibre1">too miserable, unless folded in female arms; and of the medicine of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy mercy to cure that infirmity I thought not, not having tried it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As for continency, I supposed it to be in our own power (though in</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself I did not find that power), being so foolish as not to know</p>
<p class="calibre1">what is written, None can be continent unless Thou give it; and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou wouldest give it, if with inward groanings I did knock at Thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears, and with a settled faith did cast my care on Thee.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alypius indeed kept me from marrying; alleging that so could we by</p>
<p class="calibre1">no means with undistracted leisure live together in the love of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom, as we had long desired. For himself was even then most pure in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this point, so that it was wonderful; and that the more, since in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the outset of his youth he had entered into that course, but had not</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuck fast therein; rather had he felt remorse and revolting at it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">living thenceforth until now most continently. But I opposed him</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the examples of those who as married men had cherished wisdom,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and served God acceptably, and retained their friends, and loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">them faithfully. Of whose greatness of spirit I was far short; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bound with the disease of the flesh, and its deadly sweetness, drew</p>
<p class="calibre1">along my chain, dreading to be loosed, and as if my wound had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">fretted, put back his good persuasions, as it were the hand of one</p>
<p class="calibre1">that would unchain me. Moreover, by me did the serpent speak unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alypius himself, by my tongue weaving and laying in his path</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasurable snares, wherein his virtuous and free feet might be</p>
<p class="calibre1">entangled.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For when he wondered that I, whom he esteemed not slightly, should</p>
<p class="calibre1">stick so fast in the birdlime of that pleasure, as to protest (so</p>
<p class="calibre1">oft as we discussed it) that I could never lead a single life; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">urged in my defence when I saw him wonder, that there was great</p>
<p class="calibre1">difference between his momentary and scarce-remembered knowledge of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that life, which so he might easily despise, and my continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquaintance whereto if the honourable name of marriage were added, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">ought not to wonder why I could not contemn that course; he began also</p>
<p class="calibre1">to desire to be married; not as overcome with desire of such pleasure,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but out of curiosity. For he would fain know, he said, what that</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be, without which my life, to him so pleasing, would to me seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">not life but a punishment. For his mind, free from that chain, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">amazed at my thraldom; and through that amazement was going on to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire of trying it, thence to the trial itself, and thence perhaps to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sink into that bondage whereat he wondered, seeing he was willing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make a covenant with death; and he that loves danger, shall fall</p>
<p class="calibre1">into it. For whatever honour there be in the office of well-ordering a</p>
<p class="calibre1">married life, and a family, moved us but slightly. But me for the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">part the habit of satisfying an insatiable appetite tormented, while</p>
<p class="calibre1">it held me captive; him, an admiring wonder was leading captive. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">were we, until Thou, O Most High, not forsaking our dust,</p>
<p class="calibre1">commiserating us miserable, didst come to our help, by wondrous and</p>
<p class="calibre1">secret ways.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continual effort was made to have me married. I wooed, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">promised, chiefly through my mother’s pains, that so once married, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">health-giving baptism might cleanse me, towards which she rejoiced</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I was being daily fitted, and observed that her prayers, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy promises, were being fulfilled in my faith. At which time</p>
<p class="calibre1">verily, both at my request and her own longing, with strong cries of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart she daily begged of Thee, that Thou wouldest by a vision</p>
<p class="calibre1">discover unto her something concerning my future marriage; Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">never wouldest. She saw indeed certain vain and fantastic things, such</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the energy of the human spirit, busied thereon, brought together;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and these she told me of, not with that confidence she was wont,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when Thou showedst her any thing, but slighting them. For she could,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she said, through a certain feeling, which in words she could not</p>
<p class="calibre1">express, discern betwixt Thy revelations, and the dreams of her own</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul. Yet the matter was pressed on, and a maiden asked in marriage,</p>
<p class="calibre1">two years under the fit age; and, as pleasing, was waited for.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And many of us friends conferring about, and detesting the turbulent</p>
<p class="calibre1">turmoils of human life, had debated and now almost resolved on</p>
<p class="calibre1">living apart from business and the bustle of men; and this was to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">thus obtained; we were to bring whatever we might severally procure,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and make one household of all; so that through the truth of our</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendship nothing should belong especially to any; but the whole thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">derived from all, should as a whole belong to each, and all to all. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought there might be some often persons in this society; some of</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom were very rich, especially Romanianus our townsman, from</p>
<p class="calibre1">childhood a very familiar friend of mine, whom the grievous</p>
<p class="calibre1">perplexities of his affairs had brought up to court; who was the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most earnest for this project; and therein was his voice of great</p>
<p class="calibre1">weight, because his ample estate far exceeded any of the rest. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">had settled also that two annual officers, as it were, should</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide all things necessary, the rest being undisturbed. But when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we began to consider whether the wives, which some of us already</p>
<p class="calibre1">had, others hoped to have, would allow this, all that plan, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was being so well moulded, fell to pieces in our hands, was utterly</p>
<p class="calibre1">dashed and cast aside. Thence we betook us to sighs, and groans, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">our steps to follow the broad and beaten ways of the world; for many</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts were in our heart, but Thy counsel standeth for ever. Out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of which counsel Thou didst deride ours, and preparedst Thine own;</p>
<p class="calibre1">purposing to give us meat in due season, and to fill our souls with</p>
<p class="calibre1">blessing.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile my sins were being multiplied, and my concubine being torn</p>
<p class="calibre1">from my side as a hindrance to my marriage, my heart which clave</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto her was torn and wounded and bleeding. And she returned to Afric,</p>
<p class="calibre1">vowing unto Thee never to know any other man, leaving with me my son</p>
<p class="calibre1">by her. But unhappy I, who could not imitate a very woman, impatient</p>
<p class="calibre1">of delay, inasmuch as not till after two years was I to obtain her I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sought not being so much a lover of marriage as a slave to lust,</p>
<p class="calibre1">procured another, though no wife, that so by the servitude of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">enduring custom, the disease of my soul might be kept up and carried</p>
<p class="calibre1">on in its vigour, or even augmented, into the dominion of marriage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor was that my wound cured, which had been made by the cutting away</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the former, but after inflammation and most acute pain, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">mortified, and my pains became less acute, but more desperate.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Thee be praise, glory to Thee, Fountain of mercies. I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming more miserable, and Thou nearer. Thy right hand was</p>
<p class="calibre1">continually ready to pluck me out of the mire, and to wash me</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoroughly, and I knew it not; nor did anything call me back from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet deeper gulf of carnal pleasures, but the fear of death, and of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">judgment to come; which amid all my changes, never departed from my</p>
<p class="calibre1">breast. And in my disputes with my friends Alypius and Nebridius of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the nature of good and evil, I held that Epicurus had in my mind won</p>
<p class="calibre1">the palm, had I not believed that after death there remained a life</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the soul, and places of requital according to men’s deserts, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Epicurus would not believe. And I asked, “were we immortal, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">live in perpetual bodily pleasure, without fear of losing it, why</p>
<p class="calibre1">should we not be happy, or what else should we seek?” not knowing that</p>
<p class="calibre1">great misery was involved in this very thing, that, being thus sunk</p>
<p class="calibre1">and blinded, I could not discern that light of excellence and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beauty, to be embraced for its own sake, which the eye of flesh cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">see, and is seen by the inner man. Nor did I, unhappy, consider from</p>
<p class="calibre1">what source it sprung, that even on these things, foul as they were, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">with pleasure discoursed with my friends, nor could I, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to the notions I then had of happiness, be happy without</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends, amid what abundance soever of carnal pleasures. And yet these</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends I loved for themselves only, and I felt that I was beloved</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them again for myself only.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O crooked paths! Woe to the audacious soul, which hoped, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">forsaking Thee, to gain some better thing! Turned it hath, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned again, upon back, sides, and belly, yet all was painful; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou alone rest. And behold, Thou art at hand, and deliverest us</p>
<p class="calibre1">from our wretched wanderings, and placest us in Thy way, and dost</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfort us, and say, “Run; I will carry you; yea I will bring you</p>
<p class="calibre1">through; there also will I carry you.”</p>
