<h2 id="calibre_toc_13" class="calibre7">BOOK XII</h2><p class="calibre1">My heart, O Lord, touched with the words of Thy Holy Scripture, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">much busied, amid this poverty of my life. And therefore most times,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is the poverty of human understanding copious in words, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">enquiring hath more to say than discovering, and demanding is longer</p>
<p class="calibre1">than obtaining, and our hand that knocks, hath more work to do, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">our hand that receives. We hold the promise, who shall make it null?</p>
<p class="calibre1">If God be for us, who can be against us? Ask, and ye shall have; seek,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every</p>
<p class="calibre1">one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him</p>
<p class="calibre1">that knocketh, shall it be opened. These be Thine own promises: and</p>
<p class="calibre1">who need fear to be deceived, when the Truth promiseth?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lowliness of my tongue confesseth unto Thy Highness, that Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">madest heaven and earth; this heaven which I see, and this earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I tread upon, whence is this earth that I bear about me; Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">madest it. But where is that heaven of heavens, O Lord, which we</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear of in the words of the Psalm. The heaven of heavens are the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord’s; but the earth hath He given to the children of men? Where is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that heaven which we see not, to which all this which we see is earth?</p>
<p class="calibre1">For this corporeal whole, not being wholly every where, hath in such</p>
<p class="calibre1">wise received its portion of beauty in these lower parts, whereof</p>
<p class="calibre1">the lowest is this our earth; but to that heaven of heavens, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">the heaven of our earth, is but earth: yea both these great bodies,</p>
<p class="calibre1">may not absurdly be called earth, to that unknown heaven, which is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord’s, not the sons’ of men.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now this earth was invisible and without form, and there was I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know not what depth of abyss, upon which there was no light, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">it had no shape. Therefore didst Thou command it to be written, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness was upon the face of the deep; what else than the absence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of light? For had there been light, where should it have been but by</p>
<p class="calibre1">being over all, aloft, and enlightening? Where then light was not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was the presence of darkness, but the absence of light?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkness therefore was upon it, because light was not upon it; as</p>
<p class="calibre1">where sound is not, there is silence. And what is it to have silence</p>
<p class="calibre1">there, but to have no sound there? Hast not Thou, O Lord, taught his</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul, which confesseth unto Thee? Hast not Thou taught me, Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that before Thou formedst and diversifiedst this formless matter,</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was nothing, neither colour, nor figure, nor body, nor spirit?</p>
<p class="calibre1">and yet not altogether nothing; for there was a certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">formlessness, without any beauty.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">How then should it be called, that it might be in some measure</p>
<p class="calibre1">conveyed to those of duller mind, but by some ordinary word? And what,</p>
<p class="calibre1">among all parts of the world can be found nearer to an absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">formlessness, than earth and deep? For, occupying the lowest stage,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they are less beautiful than the other higher parts are, transparent</p>
<p class="calibre1">all and shining. Wherefore then may I not conceive the formlessness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter (which Thou hadst created without beauty, whereof to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">this beautiful world) to be suitably intimated unto men, by the name</p>
<p class="calibre1">of earth invisible and without form.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">So that when thought seeketh what the sense may conceive under this,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and saith to itself, “It is no intellectual form, as life, or justice;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it is the matter of bodies; nor object of sense, because being</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible, and without form, there was in it no object of sight or</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense”;- while man’s thought thus saith to itself, it may endeavour</p>
<p class="calibre1">either to know it, by being ignorant of it; or to be ignorant, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowing it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I, Lord, if I would, by my tongue and my pen, confess unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee the whole, whatever Thyself hath taught me of that matter, -the</p>
<p class="calibre1">name whereof hearing before, and not understanding, when they who</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood it not, told me of it, so I conceived of it as having</p>
<p class="calibre1">innumerable forms and diverse, and therefore did not conceive it at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, my mind tossed up and down foul and horrible “forms” out of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">order, but yet “forms” and I called it without form not that it wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">all form, but because it had such as my mind would, if presented to</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, turn from, as unwonted and jarring, and human frailness would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubled at. And still that which I conceived, was without form, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">as being deprived of all form, but in comparison of more beautiful</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms; and true reason did persuade me, that I must utterly uncase</p>
<p class="calibre1">it of all remnants of form whatsoever, if I would conceive matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely without form; and I could not; for sooner could I imagine</p>
<p class="calibre1">that not to be at all, which should be deprived of all form, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive a thing betwixt form and nothing, neither formed, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing, a formless almost nothing. So my mind gave over to question</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereupon with my spirit, it being filled with the images of formed</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies, and changing and varying them, as it willed; and I bent myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the bodies themselves, and looked more deeply into their</p>
<p class="calibre1">changeableness, by which they cease to be what they have been, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin to be what they were not; and this same shifting from form to</p>
<p class="calibre1">form, I suspected to be through a certain formless state, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">through a mere nothing; yet this I longed to know, not to suspect</p>
<p class="calibre1">only.-If then my voice and pen would confess unto Thee the whole,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever knots Thou didst open for me in this question, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">reader would hold out to take in the whole? Nor shall my heart for all</p>
<p class="calibre1">this cease to give Thee honour, and a song of praise, for those things</p>
<p class="calibre1">which it is not able to express. For the changeableness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">changeable things, is itself capable of all those forms, into which</p>
<p class="calibre1">these changeable things are changed. And this changeableness, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is it? Is it soul? Is it body? Is it that which constituteth soul or</p>
<p class="calibre1">body? Might one say, “a nothing something”, an “is, is not,” I would</p>
<p class="calibre1">say, this were it: and yet in some way was it even then, as being</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable of receiving these visible and compound figures.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But whence had it this degree of being, but from Thee, from Whom are</p>
<p class="calibre1">all things, so far forth as they are? But so much the further from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, as the unliker Thee; for it is not farness of place. Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore, Lord, Who art not one in one place, and otherwise in</p>
<p class="calibre1">another, but the Self-same, and the Self-same, and the Self-same,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, didst in the Beginning, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is of Thee, in Thy Wisdom, which was born of Thine own Substance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">create something, and that out of nothing. For Thou createdst heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">and earth; not out of Thyself, for so should they have been equal to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thine Only Begotten Son, and thereby to Thee also; whereas no way were</p>
<p class="calibre1">it right that aught should be equal to Thee, which was not of Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And aught else besides Thee was there not, whereof Thou mightest</p>
<p class="calibre1">create them, O God, One Trinity, and Trine Unity; and therefore out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing didst Thou create heaven and earth; a great thing, and a small</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing; for Thou art Almighty and Good, to make all things good, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">the great heaven, and the petty earth. Thou wert, and nothing was</p>
<p class="calibre1">there besides, out of which Thou createdst heaven and earth; things of</p>
<p class="calibre1">two sorts; one near Thee, the other near to nothing; one to which Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone shouldest be superior; the other, to which nothing should be</p>
<p class="calibre1">inferior.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that heaven of heavens was for Thyself, O Lord; but the earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Thou gavest to the sons of men, to be seen and felt, was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">such as we now see and feel. For it was invisible, without form, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was a deep, upon which there was no light; or, darkness was</p>
<p class="calibre1">above the deep, that is, more than in the deep. Because this deep of</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters, visible now, hath even in his depths, a light proper for its</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature; perceivable in whatever degree unto the fishes, and creeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">things in the bottom of it. But that whole deep was almost nothing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because hitherto it was altogether without form; yet there was already</p>
<p class="calibre1">that which could be formed. For Thou, Lord, madest the world of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter without form, which out of nothing, Thou madest next to</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing, thereof to make those great things, which we sons of men</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonder at. For very wonderful is this corporeal heaven; of which</p>
<p class="calibre1">firmament between water and water, the second day, after the</p>
<p class="calibre1">creation of light, Thou saidst, Let it be made, and it was made. Which</p>
<p class="calibre1">firmament Thou calledst heaven; the heaven, that is, to this earth and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea, which Thou madest the third day, by giving a visible figure to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the formless matter, which Thou madest before all days. For already</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadst Thou made both an heaven, before all days; but that was the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven of this heaven; because In the beginning Thou hadst made heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">and earth. But this same earth which Thou madest was formless</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter, because it was invisible and without form, and darkness was</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the deep, of which invisible earth and without form, of which</p>
<p class="calibre1">formlessness, of which almost nothing, Thou mightest make all these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things of which this changeable world consists, but subsists not;</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose very changeableness appears therein, that times can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">observed and numbered in it. For times are made by the alterations</p>
<p class="calibre1">of things, while the figures, the matter whereof is the invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth aforesaid, are varied and turned.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And therefore the Spirit, the Teacher of Thy servant, when It</p>
<p class="calibre1">recounts Thee to have In the Beginning created heaven and earth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaks nothing of times, nothing of days. For verily that heaven of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavens which Thou createdst in the Beginning, is some intellectual</p>
<p class="calibre1">creature, which, although no ways coeternal unto Thee, the Trinity,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet partaketh of Thy eternity, and doth through the sweetness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that most happy contemplation of Thyself, strongly restrain its own</p>
<p class="calibre1">changeableness; and without any fall since its first creation,</p>
<p class="calibre1">cleaving close unto Thee, is placed beyond all the rolling vicissitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">of times. Yea, neither is this very formlessness of the earth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible, and without form, numbered among the days. For where no</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure nor order is, there does nothing come, or go; and where this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, there plainly are no days, nor any vicissitude of spaces of</p>
<p class="calibre1">times.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O let the Light, the Truth, the Light of my heart, not mine own</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness, speak unto me. I fell off into that, and became darkened;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but even thence, even thence I loved Thee. I went astray, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered Thee. I heard Thy voice behind me, calling to me to return,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and scarcely heard it, through the tumultuousness of the enemies of</p>
<p class="calibre1">peace. And now, behold, I return in distress and panting after Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">fountain. Let no man forbid me! of this will I drink, and so live. Let</p>
<p class="calibre1">me not be mine own life; from myself I lived ill, death was I to</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself; and I revive in Thee. Do Thou speak unto me, do Thou discourse</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto me. I have believed Thy Books, and their words be most full of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystery.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already Thou hast told me with a strong voice, O Lord, in my inner</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear, that Thou art eternal, Who only hast immortality; since Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">canst not be changed as to figure or motion, nor is Thy will altered</p>
<p class="calibre1">by times: seeing no will which varies is immortal. This is in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight clear to me, and let it be more and more cleared to me, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">beseech Thee; and in the manifestation thereof, let me with sobriety</p>
<p class="calibre1">abide under Thy wings. Thou hast told me also with a strong voice, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, in my inner ear, that Thou hast made all natures and substances,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which are not what Thyself is, and yet are; and that only is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Thee, which is not, and the motion of the will from Thee who art,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto that which in a less degree is, because such motion is</p>
<p class="calibre1">transgression and sin; and that no man’s sin doth either hurt Thee, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">disturb the order of Thy government, first or last. This is in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight clear unto me, and let it be more and more cleared to me, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">beseech Thee: and in the manifestation thereof, let me with sobriety</p>
<p class="calibre1">abide under Thy wings.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast told me also with a strong voice, in my inner ear, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither is that creature coeternal unto Thyself, whose happiness</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou only art, and which with a most persevering purity, drawing its</p>
<p class="calibre1">nourishment from Thee, doth in no place and at no time put forth its</p>
<p class="calibre1">natural mutability; and, Thyself being ever present with it, unto Whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">with its whole affection it keeps itself, having neither future to</p>
<p class="calibre1">expect, nor conveying into the past what it remembereth, is neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">altered by any change, nor distracted into any times. O blessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">creature, if such there be, for cleaving unto Thy Blessedness; blest</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thee, its eternal Inhabitant and its Enlightener! Nor do I find</p>
<p class="calibre1">by what name I may the rather call the heaven of heavens which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lord’s, than Thine house, which contemplateth Thy delights without</p>
<p class="calibre1">any defection of going forth to another; one pure mind, most</p>
<p class="calibre1">harmoniously one, by that settled estate of peace of holy spirits, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizens of Thy city in heavenly places; far above those heavenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">places that we see.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">By this may the soul, whose pilgrimage is made long and far away, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">this may she understand, if she now thirsts for Thee, if her tears</p>
<p class="calibre1">be now become her bread, while they daily say unto her, Where is Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">God? if she now seeks of Thee one thing, and desireth it, that she may</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwell in Thy house all the days of her life (and what is her life, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou? and what Thy days, but Thy eternity, as Thy years which fail</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, because Thou art ever the same?); by this then may the soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is able, understand how far Thou art, above all times, eternal;</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing Thy house which at no time went into a far country, although it</p>
<p class="calibre1">be not coeternal with Thee, yet by continually and unfailingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">cleaving unto Thee, suffers no changeableness of times. This is in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight clear unto me, and let it be more and more cleared unto me, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">beseech Thee, and in the manifestation thereof, let me with sobriety</p>
<p class="calibre1">abide under Thy wings.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is, behold, I know not what formlessness in those changes of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these last and lowest creatures; and who shall tell me (unless such</p>
<p class="calibre1">a one as through the emptiness of his own heart, wonders and tosses</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself up and down amid his own fancies?), who but such a one would</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell me, that if all figure be so wasted and consumed away, that there</p>
<p class="calibre1">should only remain that formlessness, through which the thing was</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed and turned from one figure to another, that that could exhibit</p>
<p class="calibre1">the vicissitudes of times? For plainly it could not, because,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without the variety of motions, there are no times: and no variety,</p>
<p class="calibre1">where there is no figure.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">These things considered, as much as Thou givest, O my God, as much</p>
<p class="calibre1">as Thou stirrest me up to knock, and as much as Thou openest to me</p>
<p class="calibre1">knocking, two things I find that Thou hast made, not within the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compass of time, neither of which is coeternal with Thee. One, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is so formed, that without any ceasing of contemplation, without any</p>
<p class="calibre1">interval of change, though changeable, yet not changed, it may</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoroughly enjoy Thy eternity and unchangeableness; the other which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was so formless, that it had not that, which could be changed from one</p>
<p class="calibre1">form into another, whether of motion, or of repose, so as to become</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject unto time. But this Thou didst not leave thus formless,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because before all days, Thou in the Beginning didst create Heaven and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth; the two things that I spake of. But the Earth was invisible and</p>
<p class="calibre1">without form, and darkness was upon the deep. In which words, is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">formlessness conveyed unto us (that such capacities may hereby be</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn on by degrees, as are not able to conceive an utter privation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all form, without yet coming to nothing), out of which another</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heaven might be created, together with a visible and well-formed</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth: and the waters diversly ordered, and whatsoever further is in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the formation of the world, recorded to have been, not without days,</p>
<p class="calibre1">created; and that, as being of such nature, that the successive</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes of times may take place in them, as being subject to appointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">alterations of motions and of forms.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This then is what I conceive, O my God, when I hear Thy Scripture</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying, In the beginning God made Heaven and Earth: and the Earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">was invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the deep, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not mentioning what day Thou createdst them; this is what I</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive, that because of the Heaven of heavens, -that intellectual</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heaven, whose Intelligences know all at once, not in part, not darkly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not through a glass, but as a whole, in manifestation, face to face;</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, this thing now, and that thing anon; but (as I said) know all</p>
<p class="calibre1">at once, without any succession of times; -and because of the earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible and without form, without any succession of times, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">succession presents “this thing now, that thing anon”; because where</p>
<p class="calibre1">is no form, there is no distinction of things: -it is, then, on</p>
<p class="calibre1">account of these two, a primitive formed, and a primitive formless;</p>
<p class="calibre1">the one, heaven but the Heaven of heaven, the other earth but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth invisible and without form; because of these two do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive, did Thy Scripture say without mention of days, In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beginning God created Heaven and Earth. For forthwith it subjoined</p>
<p class="calibre1">what earth it spake of; and also, in that the Firmament is recorded to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be created the second day, and called Heaven, it conveys to us of</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Heaven He before spake, without mention of days.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wondrous depth of Thy words! whose surface, behold! is before us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">inviting to little ones; yet are they a wondrous depth. O my God, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondrous depth! It is awful to look therein; an awfulness of honour,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and a trembling of love. The enemies thereof I hate vehemently; oh</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Thou wouldest slay them with Thy two-edged sword, that they might</p>
<p class="calibre1">no longer be enemies unto it: for so do I love to have them slain unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves, that they may live unto Thee. But behold others not</p>
<p class="calibre1">faultfinders, but extollers of the book of Genesis; “The Spirit of</p>
<p class="calibre1">God,” say they, “Who by His servant Moses wrote these things, would</p>
<p class="calibre1">not have those words thus understood; He would not have it understood,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as thou sayest, but otherwise, as we say.” Unto Whom Thyself, O Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">God all, being judge, do I thus answer.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you affirm that to be false, which with a strong voice Truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">tells me in my inner ear, concerning the Eternity of the Creator, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">His substance is no ways changed by time, nor His will separate from</p>
<p class="calibre1">His substance? Wherefore He willeth not one thing now, another anon,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but once, and at once, and always, He willeth all things that He</p>
<p class="calibre1">willeth; not again and again, nor now this, now that; nor willeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">afterwards, what before He willed not, nor willeth not, what before He</p>
<p class="calibre1">willed; because such a will is and no mutable thing is eternal: but</p>
<p class="calibre1">our God is eternal. Again, what He tells me in my inner ear, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectation of things to come becomes sight, when they are come, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">this same sight becomes memory, when they be past. Now all thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">which thus varies is mutable; and is eternal: but our God is eternal.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">These things I infer, and put together, and find that my God, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternal God, hath not upon any new will made any creature, nor doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">His knowledge admit of any thing transitory. “What will ye say then, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye gainsayers? Are these things false?” “No,” they say; “What then? Is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it false, that every nature already formed, or matter capable of form,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is not, but from Him Who is supremely good, because He is</p>
<p class="calibre1">supremely?” “Neither do we deny this,” say they. “What then? do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">deny this, that there is a certain sublime creature, with so chaste</p>
<p class="calibre1">a love cleaving unto the true and truly eternal God, that although not</p>
<p class="calibre1">coeternal with Him, yet is it not detached from Him, nor dissolved</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the variety and vicissitude of times, but reposeth in the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">true contemplation of Him only?” Because Thou, O God, unto him that</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveth Thee so much as Thou commandest, dost show Thyself, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficest him; and therefore doth he not decline from Thee, nor toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself. This is the house of God, not of earthly mould, nor of</p>
<p class="calibre1">celestial bulk corporeal but spiritual, and partaker of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternity, because without defection for ever. For Thou hast made it</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast for ever and ever, Thou hast given it a law which it shall not</p>
<p class="calibre1">pass. Nor yet is it coeternal with Thee, O God, because not without</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning; for it was made.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For although we find no time before it, for wisdom was created</p>
<p class="calibre1">before all things; not that Wisdom which is altogether equal and</p>
<p class="calibre1">coeternal unto Thee, our God, His Father, and by Whom all things</p>
<p class="calibre1">were created, and in Whom, as the Beginning, Thou createdst heaven and</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth; but that wisdom which is created, that is, the intellectual</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature, which by contemplating the light, is light. For this, though</p>
<p class="calibre1">created, is also called wisdom. But what difference there is betwixt</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Light which enlighteneth, and which is enlightened, so much is</p>
<p class="calibre1">there betwixt the Wisdom that createth, and that created; as betwixt</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Righteousness which justifieth, and the righteousness which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">made by justification. For we also are called Thy righteousness; for</p>
<p class="calibre1">so saith a certain servant of Thine, That we might be made the</p>
<p class="calibre1">righteousness of God in Him. Therefore since a certain created</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom was created before all things, the rational and intellectual</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind of that chaste city of Thine, our mother which is above, and is</p>
<p class="calibre1">free and eternal in the heavens (in what heavens, if not in those that</p>
<p class="calibre1">praise Thee, the Heaven of heavens? Because this is also the Heaven of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavens for the Lord); -though we find no time before it (because that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which hath been created before all things, precedeth also the creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">of time), yet is the Eternity of the Creator Himself before it, from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whom, being created, it took the beginning, not indeed of time (for</p>
<p class="calibre1">time itself was not yet), but of its creation.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence it is so of Thee, our God, as to be altogether other than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, and not the Self-same: because though we find time neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">before it, nor even in it (it being meet ever to behold Thy face,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor is ever drawn away from it, wherefore it is not varied by any</p>
<p class="calibre1">change), yet is there in it a liability to change, whence it would wax</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark, and chill, but that by a strong affection cleaving unto Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">like perpetual noon, it shineth and gloweth from Thee. O house most</p>
<p class="calibre1">lightsome and delightsome! I have loved thy beauty, and the place of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the habitation of the glory of my Lord, thy builder and possessor. Let</p>
<p class="calibre1">my wayfaring sigh after thee, and I say to Him that made thee, let Him</p>
<p class="calibre1">take possession of me also in thee, seeing He hath made me likewise. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have gone astray like a lost sheep: yet upon the shoulders of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shepherd, thy builder, hope I to be brought back to thee.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What say ye to me, O ye gainsayers that I was speaking unto, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet believe Moses to have been the holy servant of God, and his</p>
<p class="calibre1">books the oracles of the Holy Ghost? Is not this house of God, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">coeternal indeed with God, yet after its measure, eternal in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavens, when you seek for changes of times in vain, because you</p>
<p class="calibre1">will not find them? For that, to which it is ever good to cleave</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast to God, surpasses all extension, and all revolving periods of</p>
<p class="calibre1">time.” “It is,” say they. “What then of all that which my heart loudly</p>
<p class="calibre1">uttered unto my God, when inwardly it heard the voice of His praise,</p>
<p class="calibre1">what part thereof do you affirm to be false? Is it that the matter was</p>
<p class="calibre1">without form, in which because there was no form, there was no</p>
<p class="calibre1">order? But where no order was, there could be no vicissitude of times:</p>
<p class="calibre1">and yet this almost nothing,’ inasmuch as it was not altogether</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing, was from Him certainly, from Whom is whatsoever is, in what</p>
<p class="calibre1">degree soever it is.” “This also,” say they, “do we not deny.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">With these I now parley a little in Thy presence, O my God, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">grant all these things to be true, which Thy Truth whispers unto my</p>

<p class="calibre1">themselves as much as they please; I will essay to persuade them to</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet, and to open in them a way for Thy word. But if they refuse, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">repel me; I beseech, O my God, be not Thou silent to me. Speak Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly in my heart; for only Thou so speakest: and I will let them</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone blowing upon the dust without, and raising it up into their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own eyes: and myself will enter my chamber, and sing there a song of</p>
<p class="calibre1">loves unto Thee; groaning with groanings unutterable, in my wayfaring,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and remembering Jerusalem, with heart lifted up towards it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jerusalem my country, Jerusalem my mother, and Thyself that rulest</p>
<p class="calibre1">over it, the Enlightener, Father, Guardian, Husband, the pure and</p>

<p class="calibre1">ascertained of these things), and Thou conform and confirm it for</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever, O my God, my Mercy. But those who do not affirm all these truths</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be false, who honour Thy holy Scripture, set forth by holy Moses,</p>
<p class="calibre1">placing it, as we, on the summit of authority to be followed, and do</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet contradict me in some thing, I answer thus; By Thyself judge, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">our God, between my Confessions and these men’s contradictions.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For they say, “Though these things be true, yet did not Moses intend</p>
<p class="calibre1">those two, when, by revelation of the Spirit, he said, In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning God created heaven and earth. He did not under the name of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven, signify that spiritual or intellectual creature which always</p>
<p class="calibre1">beholds the face of God; nor under the name of earth, that formless</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter.” “What then?” “That man of God,” say they, “meant as we say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">this declared he by those words.” “What?” “By the name of heaven and</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth would he first signify,” say they, “universally and</p>
<p class="calibre1">compendiously, all this visible world; so as afterwards by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">enumeration of the several days, to arrange in detail, and, as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were, piece by piece, all those things, which it pleased the Holy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ghost thus to enounce. For such were that rude and carnal people to</p>
<p class="calibre1">which he spake, that he thought them fit to be entrusted with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge of such works of God only as were visible.” They agree,</p>
<p class="calibre1">however, that under the words earth invisible and without form, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that darksome deep (out of which it is subsequently shown, that all</p>
<p class="calibre1">these visible things which we all know, were made and arranged</p>
<p class="calibre1">during those “days”) may, not incongruously, be understood of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">formless first matter.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What now if another should say that “this same formlessness and</p>
<p class="calibre1">confusedness of matter, was for this reason first conveyed under the</p>
<p class="calibre1">name of heaven and earth, because out of it was this visible world</p>
<p class="calibre1">with all those natures which most manifestly appear in it, which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">ofttimes called by the name of heaven and earth, created and</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfected?” What again if another say that “invisible and visible</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature is not indeed inappropriately called heaven and earth; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so, that the universal creation, which God made in His Wisdom, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is, in the Beginning, was comprehended under those two words?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding, since all things be made not of the substance of God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but out of nothing (because they are not the same that God is, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there is a mutable nature in them all, whether they abide, as doth the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternal house of God, or be changed, as the soul and body of man are):</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore the common matter of all things visible and invisible (as</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet unformed though capable of form), out of which was to be created</p>
<p class="calibre1">both heaven and earth (i. the invisible and visible creature when</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed), was entitled by the same names given to the earth invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">and without form and the darkness upon the deep, but with this</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinction, that by the earth invisible and without form is</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood corporeal matter, antecedent to its being qualified by</p>
<p class="calibre1">any form; and by the darkness upon the deep, spiritual matter,</p>
<p class="calibre1">before it underwent any restraint of its unlimited fluidness, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">received any light from Wisdom?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It yet remains for a man to say, if he will, that “the already</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfected and formed natures, visible and invisible, are not signified</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the name of heaven and earth, when we read, In the beginning God</p>
<p class="calibre1">made heaven and earth, but that the yet unformed commencement of</p>
<p class="calibre1">things, the stuff apt to receive form and making, was called by</p>
<p class="calibre1">these names, because therein were confusedly contained, not as yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinguished by their qualities and forms, all those things which</p>
<p class="calibre1">being now digested into order, are called Heaven and Earth, the one</p>
<p class="calibre1">being the spiritual, the other the corporeal, creation.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">All which things being heard and well considered, I will not</p>
<p class="calibre1">strive about words: for that is profitable to nothing, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subversion of the hearers. But the law is good to edify, if a man</p>
<p class="calibre1">use it lawfully: for that the end of it is charity, out of a pure</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart and good conscience, and faith unfeigned. And well did our</p>
<p class="calibre1">Master know, upon which two commandments He hung all the Law and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prophets. And what doth it prejudice me, O my God, Thou light of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes in secret, zealously confessing these things, since divers things</p>
<p class="calibre1">may be understood under these words which yet are all true, -what, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">say, doth it prejudice me, if I think otherwise than another</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinketh the writer thought? All we readers verily strive to trace out</p>
<p class="calibre1">and to understand his meaning whom we read; and seeing we believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">him to speak truly, we dare not imagine him to have said any thing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which ourselves either know or think to be false. While every man</p>
<p class="calibre1">endeavours then to understand in the Holy Scriptures, the same as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the writer understood, what hurt is it, if a man understand what Thou,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the light of all true-speaking minds, dost show him to be true,</p>
<p class="calibre1">although he whom he reads, understood not this, seeing he also</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood a Truth, though not this truth?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For true it is, O Lord, that Thou madest heaven and earth; and it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">true too, that the Beginning is Thy Wisdom, in Which Thou createst</p>
<p class="calibre1">all: and true again, that this visible world hath for its greater part</p>
<p class="calibre1">the heaven and the earth, which briefly comprise all made and</p>
<p class="calibre1">created natures. And true too, that whatsoever is mutable, gives us to</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand a certain want of form, whereby it receiveth a form, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">is changed, or turned. It is true, that that is subject to no times,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which so cleaveth to the unchangeable Form, as though subject to</p>
<p class="calibre1">change, never to be changed. It is true, that that formlessness</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is almost nothing, cannot be subject to the alteration of times.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is true, that that whereof a thing is made, may by a certain mode</p>
<p class="calibre1">of speech, be called by the name of the thing made of it; whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">that formlessness, whereof heaven and earth were made, might be called</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and earth. It is true, that of things having form, there is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">any nearer to having no form, than the earth and the deep. It is true,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that not only every created and formed thing, but whatsoever is</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable of being created and formed, Thou madest, of Whom are all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things. It is true, that whatsoever is formed out of that which had no</p>
<p class="calibre1">form, was unformed before it was formed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out of these truths, of which they doubt not whose inward eye Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast enabled to see such things, and who unshakenly believe Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servant Moses to have spoken in the Spirit of truth; -of all these</p>
<p class="calibre1">then, he taketh one, who saith, In the Beginning God made the heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the earth; that is, “in His Word coeternal with Himself, God</p>
<p class="calibre1">made the intelligible and the sensible, or the spiritual and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporeal creature.” He another, that saith, In the Beginning God made</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and earth; that is, “in His Word coeternal with Himself, did</p>
<p class="calibre1">God make the universal bulk of this corporeal world, together with all</p>
<p class="calibre1">those apparent and known creatures, which it containeth.” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">another, that saith, In the Beginning God made heaven and earth;</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is, “in His Word coeternal with Himself, did God make the</p>
<p class="calibre1">formless matter of creatures spiritual and corporeal.” He another,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that saith, In the Beginning God created heaven and earth; that is,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“in His Word coeternal with Himself, did God create the formless</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter of the creature corporeal, wherein heaven and earth lay as</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet confused, which, being now distinguished and formed, we at this</p>
<p class="calibre1">day see in the bulk of this world.” He another, who saith, In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beginning God made heaven and earth; that is, “in the very beginning</p>
<p class="calibre1">of creating and working, did God make that formless matter, confusedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">containing in itself both heaven and earth; out of which, being</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed, do they now stand out, and are apparent, with all that is in</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with regard to the understanding of the words following, out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of all those truths, he chooses one to himself, who saith, But the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth was invisible, and without form, and darkness was upon the deep;</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is, “that corporeal thing that God made, was as yet a formless</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter of corporeal things, without order, without light. ” Another he</p>
<p class="calibre1">who says, The earth was invisible and without form, and darkness was</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the deep; that is, “this all, which is called heaven and earth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">was still a formless and darksome matter, of which the corporeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and the corporeal earth were to be made, with all things in</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, which are known to our corporeal senses.” Another he who says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">The earth was invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deep; that is, “this all, which is called heaven and earth, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still a formless and a darksome matter; out of which was to be made,</p>
<p class="calibre1">both that intelligible heaven, otherwhere called the Heaven of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavens, and the earth, that is, the whole corporeal nature, under</p>
<p class="calibre1">which name is comprised this corporeal heaven also; in a word, out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of which every visible and invisible creature was to be created.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another he who says, The earth was invisible and without form, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness was upon the deep, “the Scripture did not call that</p>
<p class="calibre1">formlessness by the name of heaven and earth; but that formlessness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">saith he, already was, which he called the earth invisible without</p>
<p class="calibre1">form, and darkness upon the deep; of which he had before said, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">God had made heaven and earth, namely, the spiritual and corporeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">creature.” Another he who says, The earth was invisible and without</p>
<p class="calibre1">form, and darkness was upon the deep; that is, “there already was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain formless matter, of which the Scripture said before, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">God made heaven and earth; namely, the whole corporeal bulk of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world, divided into two great parts, upper and lower, with all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">common and known creatures in them.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For should any attempt to dispute against these two last opinions,</p>
<p class="calibre1">thus, “If you will not allow, that this formlessness of matter seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be called by the name of heaven and earth; Ergo, there was</p>
<p class="calibre1">something which God had not made, out of which to make heaven and</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth; for neither hath Scripture told us, that God made this</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter, unless we understand it to be signified by the name of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and earth, or of earth alone, when it is said, In the Beginning</p>
<p class="calibre1">God made the heaven and earth; that so in what follows, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth was invisible and without form (although it pleased Him so to</p>
<p class="calibre1">call the formless matter), we are to understand no other matter, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">that which God made, whereof is written above, God made heaven and</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth.” The maintainers of either of those two latter opinions will,</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon hearing this, return for answer, “we do not deny this formless</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter to be indeed created by God, that God of Whom are all things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">very good; for as we affirm that to be a greater good, which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">created and formed, so we confess that to be a lesser good which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">made capable of creation and form, yet still good. We say however that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scripture hath not set down, that God made this formlessness, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">also it hath not many others; as the Cherubim, and Seraphim, and those</p>
<p class="calibre1">which the Apostle distinctly speaks of, Thrones, Dominions,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Principalities, Powers. All which that God made, is most apparent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or if in that which is said, He made heaven and earth, all things be</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehended, what shall we say of the waters, upon which the Spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">of God moved? For if they be comprised in this word earth; how then</p>
<p class="calibre1">can formless matter be meant in that name of earth, when we see the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters so beautiful? Or if it be so taken; why then is it written,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that out of the same formlessness, the firmament was made, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">called heaven; and that the waters were made, is not written? For</p>
<p class="calibre1">the waters remain not formless and invisible, seeing we behold them</p>
<p class="calibre1">flowing in so comely a manner. But if they then received that</p>
<p class="calibre1">beauty, when God said, Let the waters under the firmament be</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathered together, that so the gathering together be itself the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forming of them; what will be said as to those waters above the</p>
<p class="calibre1">firmament? Seeing neither if formless would they have been worthy of</p>
<p class="calibre1">so honourable a seat, nor is it written, by what word they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed. If then Genesis is silent as to God’s making of any thing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which yet that God did make neither sound faith nor well-grounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding doubteth, nor again will any sober teaching dare to</p>
<p class="calibre1">affirm these waters to be coeternal with God, on the ground that we</p>
<p class="calibre1">find them to be mentioned in the hook of Genesis, but when they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">created, we do not find; why (seeing truth teaches us) should we not</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand that formless matter (which this Scripture calls the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth invisible and without form, and darksome deep) to have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">created of God out of nothing, and therefore not to be coeternal to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him; notwithstanding this history hath omitted to show when it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">created?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">These things then being heard and perceived, according to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakness of my capacity (which I confess unto Thee, O Lord, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowest it), two sorts of disagreements I see may arise, when a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing is in words related by true reporters; one, concerning the truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the things, the other, concerning the meaning of the relater. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">we enquire one way about the making of the creature, what is true;</p>
<p class="calibre1">another way, what Moses, that excellent minister of Thy Faith, would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have his reader and hearer understand by those words. For the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort, away with all those who imagine themselves to know as a truth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">what is false; and for this other, away with all them too, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine Moses to have written things that be false. But let me be</p>
<p class="calibre1">united in Thee, O Lord, with those and delight myself in Thee, with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them that feed on Thy truth, in the largeness of charity, and let us</p>
<p class="calibre1">approach together unto the words of Thy book, and seek in them for Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">meaning, through the meaning of Thy servant, by whose pen Thou hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispensed them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But which of us shall, among those so many truths, which occur to</p>
<p class="calibre1">enquirers in those words, as they are differently understood, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">discover that one meaning, as to affirm, “this Moses thought,” and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“this would he have understood in that history”; with the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidence as he would, “this is true,” whether Moses thought this</p>
<p class="calibre1">or that? For behold, O my God, I Thy servant, who have in this book</p>
<p class="calibre1">vowed a sacrifice of confession unto Thee, and pray, that by Thy mercy</p>
<p class="calibre1">I may pay my vows unto Thee, can I, with the same confidence wherewith</p>
<p class="calibre1">I affirm, that in Thy incommutable world Thou createdst all things</p>
<p class="calibre1">visible and invisible, affirm also, that Moses meant no other than</p>
<p class="calibre1">this, when he wrote, In the Beginning God made heaven and earth? No.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because I see not in his mind, that he thought of this when he wrote</p>
<p class="calibre1">these things, as I do see it in Thy truth to be certain. For he</p>
<p class="calibre1">might have his thoughts upon God’s commencement of creating, when he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said In the beginning; and by heaven and earth, in this place he might</p>
<p class="calibre1">intend no formed and perfected nature whether spiritual or</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporeal, but both of them inchoate and as yet formless. For I</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceive, that whichsoever of the two had been said, it might have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been truly said; but which of the two he thought of in these words,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I do not so perceive. Although, whether it were either of these, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">any sense beside (that I have not here mentioned), which this so great</p>
<p class="calibre1">man saw in his mind, when he uttered these words, I doubt not but that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he saw it truly, and expressed it aptly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let no man harass me then, by saying, Moses thought not as you</p>
<p class="calibre1">say, but as I say: for if he should ask me, “How know you that Moses</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought that which you infer out of his words?” I ought to take it</p>
<p class="calibre1">in good part, and would answer perchance as I have above, or something</p>
<p class="calibre1">more at large, if he were unyielding. But when he saith, “Moses</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant not what you say, but what I say,” yet denieth not that what</p>
<p class="calibre1">each of us say, may both be true, O my God, life of the poor, in Whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">bosom is no contradiction, pour down a softening dew into my heart,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I may patiently bear with such as say this to me, not because</p>
<p class="calibre1">they have a divine Spirit, and have seen in the heart of Thy servant</p>
<p class="calibre1">what they speak, but because they be proud; not knowing Moses’</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion, but loving their own, not because it is truth, but because it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is theirs. Otherwise they would equally love another true opinion,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as I love what they say, when they say true: not because it is theirs,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but because it is true; and on that very ground not theirs because</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is true. But if they therefore love it, because it is true, then is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it both theirs, and mine; as being in common to all lovers of truth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But whereas they contend that Moses did not mean what I say, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">what they say, this I like not, love not: for though it were so, yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">that their rashness belongs not to knowledge, but to overboldness, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not insight but vanity was its parent. And therefore, O Lord, are</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy judgements terrible; seeing Thy truth is neither mine, nor his,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor another’s; but belonging to us all, whom Thou callest publicly</p>
<p class="calibre1">to partake of it, warning us terribly, not to account it private to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves, lest we he deprived of it. For whosoever challenges that as</p>
<p class="calibre1">proper to himself, which Thou propoundest to all to enjoy, and would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have that his own which belongs to all, is driven from what is in</p>
<p class="calibre1">common to his own; that is, from truth, to a lie. For he that speaketh</p>
<p class="calibre1">a lie, speaketh it of his own.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearken, O God, Thou best judge; Truth Itself, hearken to what I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall say to this gainsayer, hearken, for before Thee do I speak,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and before my brethren, who employ Thy law lawfully, to the end of</p>
<p class="calibre1">charity: hearken and behold, if it please Thee, what I shall say to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. For this brotherly and peaceful word do I return unto Him: “If we</p>
<p class="calibre1">both see that to be true that Thou sayest, and both see that to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">true that I say, where, I pray Thee, do we see it? Neither I in</p>
<p class="calibre1">thee, nor thou in me; but both in the unchangeable Truth itself, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is above our souls.” Seeing then we strive not about the very light of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lord God, why strive we about the thoughts of our neighbour</p>
<p class="calibre1">which we cannot so see, as the unchangeable Truth is seen: for that,</p>
<p class="calibre1">if Moses himself had appeared to us and said, “This I meant”;</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither so should we see it, but should believe it. Let us not then be</p>
<p class="calibre1">puffed up for one against another, above that which is written: let us</p>
<p class="calibre1">love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">with all our mind: and our neighbour as ourself. With a view to</p>
<p class="calibre1">which two precepts of charity, unless we believe that Moses meant,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever in those books he did mean, we shall make God a liar,</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagining otherwise of our fellow servant’s mind, than he hath</p>
<p class="calibre1">taught us. Behold now, how foolish it is, in such abundance of most</p>
<p class="calibre1">true meanings, as may be extracted out of those words, rashly to</p>
<p class="calibre1">affirm, which of them Moses principally meant; and with pernicious</p>
<p class="calibre1">contentions to offend charity itself, for whose sake he spake every</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, whose words we go about to expound.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet I, O my God, Thou lifter up of my humility, and rest of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">labour, Who hearest my confessions, and forgivest my sins: seeing Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">commandest me to love my neighbour as myself, I cannot believe that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou gavest a less gift unto Moses Thy faithful servant, than I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would wish or desire Thee to have given me, had I been born in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time he was, and hadst Thou set me in that office, that by the service</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my heart and tongue those books might be dispensed, which for so</p>
<p class="calibre1">long after were to profit all nations, and through the whole world</p>
<p class="calibre1">from such an eminence of authority, were to surmount all sayings of</p>
<p class="calibre1">false and proud teachings. I should have desired verily, had I then</p>
<p class="calibre1">been Moses (for we all come from the same lump, and what is man,</p>
<p class="calibre1">saving that Thou art mindful of him?), I would then, had I been then</p>
<p class="calibre1">what he was, and been enjoined by Thee to write the book of Genesis,</p>
<p class="calibre1">have desired such a power of expression and such a style to be given</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, that neither they who cannot yet understand how God created, might</p>
<p class="calibre1">reject the sayings, as beyond their capacity; and they who had</p>
<p class="calibre1">attained thereto, might find what true opinion soever they had by</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought arrived at, not passed over in those few words of that Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servant: and should another man by the light of truth have</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered another, neither should that fail of being discoverable</p>
<p class="calibre1">in those same words.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For as a fountain within a narrow compass, is more plentiful, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplies a tide for more streams over larger spaces, than any one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">those streams, which, after a wide interval, is derived from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same fountain; so the relation of that dispenser of Thine, which was</p>
<p class="calibre1">to benefit many who were to discourse thereon, does out of a narrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">scantling of language, overflow into streams of clearest truth, whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">every man may draw out for himself such truth as he can upon these</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjects, one, one truth, another, another, by larger</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumlocutions of discourse. For some, when they read, or hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">these words, conceive that God like a man or some mass endued with</p>
<p class="calibre1">unbounded power, by some new and sudden resolution, did, exterior to</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself, as it were at a certain distance, create heaven and earth, two</p>
<p class="calibre1">great bodies above and below, wherein all things were to be contained.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And when they hear, God said, Let it be made, and it was made; they</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive of words begun and ended, sounding in time, and passing away;</p>
<p class="calibre1">after whose departure, that came into being, which was commanded so to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do; and whatever of the like sort, men’s acquaintance with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">material world would suggest. In whom, being yet little ones and</p>
<p class="calibre1">carnal, while their weakness is by this humble kind of speech, carried</p>
<p class="calibre1">on, as in a mother’s bosom, their faith is wholesomely built up,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby they hold assured, that God made all natures, which in</p>
<p class="calibre1">admirable variety their eye beholdeth around. Which words, if any</p>
<p class="calibre1">despising, as too simple, with a proud weakness, shall stretch himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond the guardian nest; he will, alas, fall miserably. Have pity,</p>
<p class="calibre1">O Lord God, lest they who go by the way trample on the unfledged bird,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and send Thine angel to replace it into the nest, that it may live,</p>
<p class="calibre1">till it can fly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But others, unto whom these words are no longer a nest, but deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">shady fruit-bowers, see the fruits concealed therein, fly joyously</p>
<p class="calibre1">around, and with cheerful notes seek out, and pluck them. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading or hearing these words, they see that all times past and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come, are surpassed by Thy eternal and stable abiding; and yet that</p>
<p class="calibre1">there is no creature formed in time, not of Thy making. Whose will,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it is the same that Thou art, Thou madest all things, not by</p>
<p class="calibre1">any change of will, nor by a will, which before was not, and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">these things were not out of Thyself, in Thine own likeness, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is the form of all things; but out of nothing, a formless</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlikeness, which should be formed by Thy likeness (recurring to Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unity, according to their appointed capacity, so far as is given to</p>
<p class="calibre1">each thing in his kind), and might all be made very good; whether they</p>
<p class="calibre1">abide around Thee, or being in gradation removed in time and place,</p>
<p class="calibre1">made or undergo the beautiful variations of the Universe. These things</p>
<p class="calibre1">they see, and rejoice, in the little degree they here may, in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">light of Thy truth.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another bends his mind on that which is said, In the Beginning God</p>
<p class="calibre1">made heaven and earth; and beholdeth therein Wisdom, the Beginning</p>
<p class="calibre1">because It also speaketh unto us. Another likewise bends his mind on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same words, and by Beginning understands the commencement of</p>
<p class="calibre1">things created; In the beginning He made, as if it were said, He at</p>
<p class="calibre1">first made. And among them that understand In the Beginning to mean,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“In Thy Wisdom Thou createdst heaven and earth,” one believes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter out of which the heaven and earth were to be created, to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">there called heaven and earth; another, natures already formed and</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinguished; another, one formed nature, and that a spiritual, under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the name Heaven, the other formless, a corporeal matter, under the</p>
<p class="calibre1">name Earth. They again who by the names heaven and earth, understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter as yet formless, out of which heaven and earth were to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed, neither do they understand it in one way; but the one, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter out of which both the intelligible and the sensible creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">were to be perfected; another, that only, out of which this sensible</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporeal mass was to he made, containing in its vast bosom these</p>
<p class="calibre1">visible and ordinary natures. Neither do they, who believe the</p>
<p class="calibre1">creatures already ordered and arranged, to be in this place called</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and earth, understand the same; but the one, both the invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">and visible, the other, the visible only, in which we behold this</p>
<p class="calibre1">lightsome heaven, and darksome earth, with the things in them</p>
<p class="calibre1">contained.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he that no otherwise understands In the Beginning He made,</p>
<p class="calibre1">than if it were said, At first He made, can only truly understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and earth of the matter of heaven and earth, that is, of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">universal intelligible and corporeal creation. For if he would</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand thereby the universe, as already formed, it may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">rightly demanded of him, “If God made this first, what made He</p>
<p class="calibre1">afterwards?” and after the universe, he will find nothing; whereupon</p>
<p class="calibre1">must he against his will hear another question; “How did God make this</p>
<p class="calibre1">first, if nothing after?” But when he says, God made matter first</p>
<p class="calibre1">formless, then formed, there is no absurdity, if he be but qualified</p>
<p class="calibre1">to discern, what precedes by eternity, what by time, what by choice,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and what in original. By eternity, as God is before all things; by</p>
<p class="calibre1">time, as the flower before the fruit; by choice, as the fruit before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the flower; by original, as the sound before the tune. Of these</p>
<p class="calibre1">four, the first and last mentioned, are with extreme difficulty</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood, the two middle, easily. For a rare and too lofty a</p>
<p class="calibre1">vision is it, to behold Thy Eternity, O Lord, unchangeably making</p>
<p class="calibre1">things changeable; and thereby before them. And who, again, is of so</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharpsighted understanding, as to be able without great pains to</p>
<p class="calibre1">discern, how the sound is therefore before the tune; because a tune is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a formed sound; and a thing not formed, may exist; whereas that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which existeth not, cannot be formed. Thus is the matter before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing made; not because it maketh it, seeing itself is rather made;</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor is it before by interval of time; for we do not first in time</p>
<p class="calibre1">utter formless sounds without singing, and subsequently adapt or</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashion them into the form of a chant, as wood or silver, whereof a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest or vessel is fashioned. For such materials do by time also</p>
<p class="calibre1">precede the forms of the things made of them, but in singing it is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">so; for when it is sung, its sound is heard; for there is not first</p>
<p class="calibre1">a formless sound, which is afterwards formed into a chant. For each</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound, so soon as made, passeth away, nor canst thou find ought to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recall and by art to compose. So then the chant is concentrated in its</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound, which sound of his is his matter. And this indeed is formed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it may be a tune; and therefore (as I said) the matter of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound is before the form of the tune; not before, through any power it</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath to make it a tune; for a sound is no way the workmaster of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tune; but is something corporeal, subjected to the soul which singeth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereof to make a tune. Nor is it first in time; for it is given forth</p>
<p class="calibre1">together with the tune; nor first in choice, for a sound is not better</p>
<p class="calibre1">than a tune, a tune being not only a sound, but a beautiful sound. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is first in original, because a tune receives not form to become</p>
<p class="calibre1">a sound, but a sound receives a form to become a tune. By this</p>
<p class="calibre1">example, let him that is able, understand how the matter of things was</p>
<p class="calibre1">first made, and called heaven and earth, because heaven and earth were</p>
<p class="calibre1">made out of it. Yet was it not made first in time; because the forms</p>
<p class="calibre1">of things give rise to time; but that was without form, but now is, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">time, an object of sense together with its form. And yet nothing can</p>
<p class="calibre1">be related of that matter, but as though prior in time, whereas in</p>
<p class="calibre1">value it is last (because things formed are superior to things without</p>
<p class="calibre1">form) and is preceded by the Eternity of the Creator: that so there</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be out of nothing, whereof somewhat might be created.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this diversity of the true opinions, let Truth herself produce</p>
<p class="calibre1">concord. And our God have mercy upon us, that we may use the law</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawfully, the end of the commandment, pure charity. By this if man</p>
<p class="calibre1">demands of me, “which of these was the meaning of Thy servant</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moses”; this were not the language of my Confessions, should I not</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess unto Thee, “I know not”; and yet I know that those senses</p>
<p class="calibre1">are true, those carnal ones excepted, of which I have spoken what</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed necessary. And even those hopeful little ones who so think,</p>
<p class="calibre1">have this benefit, that the words of Thy Book affright them not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">delivering high things lowlily, and with few words a copious</p>
<p class="calibre1">meaning. And all we who, I confess, see and express the truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">delivered in those words, let us love one another, and jointly love</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee our God, the fountain of truth, if we are athirst for it, and not</p>
<p class="calibre1">for vanities; yea, let us so honour this Thy servant, the dispenser of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this Scripture, full of Thy Spirit, as to believe that, when by Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">revelation he wrote these things, he intended that, which among them</p>
<p class="calibre1">chiefly excels both for light of truth, and fruitfulness of profit.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">So when one says, “Moses meant as I do”; and another, “Nay, but as I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do,” I suppose that I speak more reverently, “Why not rather as</p>
<p class="calibre1">both, if both be true?” And if there be a third, or a fourth, yea if</p>
<p class="calibre1">any other seeth any other truth in those words, why may not he be</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed to have seen all these, through whom the One God hath</p>
<p class="calibre1">tempered the holy Scriptures to the senses of many, who should see</p>
<p class="calibre1">therein things true but divers? For I certainly (and fearlessly I</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak it from my heart), that were I to indite any thing to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">supreme authority, I should prefer so to write, that whatever truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">any could apprehend on those matters, might he conveyed in my words,</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than set down my own meaning so clearly as to exclude the rest,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which not being false, could not offend me. I will not therefore, O my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, be so rash, as not to believe, that Thou vouchsafedst as much</p>
<p class="calibre1">to that great man. He without doubt, when he wrote those words,</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceived and thought on what truth soever we have been able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find, yea and whatsoever we have not been able, nor yet are, but which</p>
<p class="calibre1">may be found in them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lastly, O Lord, who art God and not flesh and blood, if man did</p>
<p class="calibre1">see less, could any thing be concealed from Thy good Spirit (who shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead me into the land of uprightness), which Thou Thyself by those</p>
<p class="calibre1">words wert about to reveal to readers in times to come, though he</p>
<p class="calibre1">through whom they were spoken, perhaps among many true meanings,</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought on some one? which if so it be, let that which he thought on</p>
<p class="calibre1">be of all the highest. But to us, O Lord, do Thou, either reveal</p>
<p class="calibre1">that same, or any other true one which Thou pleasest; that so, whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou discoverest the same to us, as to that Thy servant, or some other</p>
<p class="calibre1">by occasion of those words, yet Thou mayest feed us, not error deceive</p>
<p class="calibre1">us. Behold, O Lord my God, how much we have written upon a few</p>
<p class="calibre1">words, how much I beseech Thee! What strength of ours, yea what ages</p>
<p class="calibre1">would suffice for all Thy books in this manner? Permit me then in</p>
<p class="calibre1">these more briefly to confess unto Thee, and to choose some one</p>
