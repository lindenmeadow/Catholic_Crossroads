<h2 id="calibre_toc_14" class="calibre7">BOOK XIII</h2><p class="calibre1">I call upon Thee, O my God, my mercy, Who createdst me, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgottest not me, forgetting Thee. I call Thee into my soul which, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the longing Thyself inspirest into her, Thou preparest for Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Forsake me not now calling upon Thee, whom Thou preventedst before I</p>
<p class="calibre1">called, and urgedst me with much variety of repeated calls, that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would hear Thee from afar, and be converted, and call upon Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that calledst after me; for Thou, Lord, blottedst out all my evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">deservings, so as not to repay into my hands, wherewith I fell from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee; and Thou hast prevented all my well deservings, so as to repay</p>
<p class="calibre1">the work of Thy hands wherewith Thou madest me; because before I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was, Thou wert; nor was I any thing, to which Thou mightest grant to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be; and yet behold, I am, out of Thy goodness, preventing all this</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Thou hast made me, and whereof Thou hast made me. For neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadst Thou need of me, nor am I any such good, as to be helpful unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, my Lord and God; not in serving Thee, as though Thou wouldest</p>
<p class="calibre1">tire in working; or lest Thy power might be less, if lacking my</p>
<p class="calibre1">service: nor cultivating Thy service, as a land, that must remain</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncultivated, unless I cultivated Thee: but serving and worshipping</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, that I might receive a well-being from Thee, from whom it comes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I have a being capable of well-being.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For of the fulness of Thy goodness, doth Thy creature subsist,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that so a good, which could no ways profit Thee, nor was of Thee (lest</p>
<p class="calibre1">so it should be equal to Thee), might yet be since it could be made of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. For what did heaven and earth, which Thou madest in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beginning, deserve of Thee? Let those spiritual and corporeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">natures which Thou madest in Thy Wisdom, say wherein they deserved</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thee, to depend thereon (even in that their several inchoate and</p>
<p class="calibre1">formless state, whether spiritual or corporeal, ready to fall away</p>
<p class="calibre1">into an immoderate liberty and far-distant unlikeliness unto Thee;</p>
<p class="calibre1">-the spiritual, though without form, superior to the corporeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">though formed, and the corporeal though without form, better than were</p>
<p class="calibre1">it altogether nothing), and so to depend upon Thy Word, as formless,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless by the same Word they were brought back to Thy Unity, indued</p>
<p class="calibre1">with form and from Thee the One Sovereign Good were made all very</p>
<p class="calibre1">good. How did they deserve of Thee, to be even without form, since</p>
<p class="calibre1">they had not been even this, but from Thee?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did corporeal matter deserve of Thee, to be even invisible and</p>
<p class="calibre1">without form? seeing it were not even this, but that Thou madest it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and therefore because it was not, could not deserve of Thee to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">made. Or how could the inchoate spiritual creature deserve of Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">even to ebb and flow darksomely like the deep, -unlike Thee, unless it</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been by the same Word turned to that, by Whom it was created,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and by Him so enlightened, become light; though not equally, yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">conformably to that Form which is equal unto Thee? For as in a body,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be, is not one with being beautiful, else could it not be deformed;</p>
<p class="calibre1">so likewise to a created spirit to live, is not one with living</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisely; else should it be wise unchangeably. But good it is for it</p>
<p class="calibre1">always to hold fast to Thee; lest what light it hath obtained by</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning to Thee, it lose by turning from Thee, and relapse into life</p>
<p class="calibre1">resembling the darksome deep. For we ourselves also, who as to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul are a spiritual creature, turned away from Thee our light, were</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that life sometimes darkness; and still labour amidst the relics of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our darkness, until in Thy Only One we become Thy righteousness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">like the mountains of God. For we have been Thy judgments, which are</p>
<p class="calibre1">like the great deep.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">That which Thou saidst in the beginning of the creation, Let there</p>
<p class="calibre1">be light, and there was light; I do, not unsuitably, understand of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual creature: because there was already a sort of life, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou mightest illuminate. But as it had no claim on Thee for a life,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which could be enlightened, so neither now that it was, had it any, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be enlightened. For neither could its formless estate be pleasing unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, unless it became light, and that not by existing simply, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">by beholding the illuminating light, and cleaving to it; so that, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it lived, and lived happily, it owes to nothing but Thy grace, being</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned by a better change unto That which cannot be changed into worse</p>
<p class="calibre1">or better; which Thou alone art, because Thou alone simply art; unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee it being not one thing to live, another to live blessedly, seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyself art Thine own Blessedness.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then could he wanting unto Thy good, which Thou Thyself art,</p>
<p class="calibre1">although these things had either never been, or remained without form;</p>
<p class="calibre1">which thou madest, not out of any want, but out of the fulness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy goodness, restraining them and converting them to form, not as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though Thy joy were fulfilled by them? For to Thee being perfect, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">their imperfection displeasing, and hence were they perfected by Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and please Thee; not as wert Thou imperfect, and by their perfecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">wert also to be perfected. For Thy good Spirit indeed was borne over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the waters, not borne up by them, as if He rested upon them. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">those, on whom Thy good Spirit is said to rest, He causes to rest in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Himself. But Thy incorruptible and unchangeable will, in itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">all-sufficient for itself, was borne upon that life which Thou hadst</p>
<p class="calibre1">created; to which, living is not one with happy living, seeing it</p>
<p class="calibre1">liveth also, ebbing and flowing in its own darkness: for which it</p>
<p class="calibre1">remaineth to be converted unto Him, by Whom it was made, and to live</p>
<p class="calibre1">more and more by the fountain of life, and in His light to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">light, and to be perfected, and enlightened, and beautified.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lo, now the Trinity appears unto me in a glass darkly, which is Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">my God, because Thou, O Father, in Him Who is the Beginning of our</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom, Which is Thy Wisdom, born of Thyself, equal unto Thee and</p>
<p class="calibre1">coeternal, that is, in Thy Son, createdst heaven and earth. Much now</p>
<p class="calibre1">have we said of the Heaven of heavens, and of the earth invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">and without form, and of the darksome deep, in reference to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wandering instability of its spiritual deformity, unless it had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">converted unto Him, from Whom it had its then degree of life, and by</p>
<p class="calibre1">His enlightening became a beauteous life, and the heaven of that</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven, which was afterwards set between water and water. And under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the name of God, I now held the Father, who made these things, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the name of Beginning, the Son, in whom He made these things;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and believing, as I did, my God as the Trinity, I searched further</p>
<p class="calibre1">in His holy words, and to, Thy Spirit moved upon the waters. Behold</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Trinity, my God, Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, Creator of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">creation.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what was the cause, O true-speaking Light? -unto Thee lift I</p>
<p class="calibre1">up my heart, let it not teach me vanities, dispel its darkness; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell me, I beseech Thee, by our mother charity, tell me the reason,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I beseech Thee, why after the mention of heaven, and of the earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible and without form, and darkness upon the deep, Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scripture should then at length mention Thy Spirit? Was it because</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was meet that the knowledge of Him should be conveyed, as being</p>
<p class="calibre1">“borne above”; and this could not be said, unless that were first</p>
<p class="calibre1">mentioned, over which Thy Spirit may be understood to have been borne.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For neither was He borne above the Father, nor the Son, nor could He</p>
<p class="calibre1">rightly be said to be borne above, if He were borne over nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First then was that to be spoken of, over which He might be borne; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then He, whom it was meet not otherwise to be spoken of than as</p>
<p class="calibre1">being borne. But wherefore was it not meet that the knowledge of Him</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be conveyed otherwise, than as being borne above?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence let him that is able, follow with his understanding Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apostle, where he thus speaks, Because Thy love is shed abroad in</p>
<p class="calibre1">our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us: and where</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerning spiritual gifts, he teacheth and showeth unto us a more</p>
<p class="calibre1">excellent way of charity; and where he bows his knee unto Thee for us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we may know the supereminent knowledge of the love of Christ. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore from the beginning, was He borne supereminent above the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters. To whom shall I speak this? how speak of the weight of evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">desires, downwards to the steep abyss; and how charity raises up again</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Thy Spirit which was borne above the waters? to whom shall I</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak it? how speak it? For it is not in space that we are merged</p>
<p class="calibre1">and emerge. What can be more, and yet what less like? They be</p>
<p class="calibre1">affections, they be loves; the uncleanness of our spirit flowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">away downwards with the love of cares, and the holiness of Thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">raising us upward by love of unanxious repose; that we may lift our</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearts unto Thee, where Thy Spirit is borne above the waters; and come</p>
<p class="calibre1">to that supereminent repose, when our soul shall have passed through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the waters which yield no support.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angels fell away, man’s soul fell away, and thereby pointed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">abyss in that dark depth, ready for the whole spiritual creation,</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadst not Thou said from the beginning, Let there be light, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there had been light, and every obedient intelligence of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavenly City had cleaved to Thee, and rested in Thy Spirit, Which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is borne unchangeably over every thing changeable. Otherwise, had even</p>
<p class="calibre1">the heaven of heavens been in itself a darksome deep; but now it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">light in the Lord. For even in that miserable restlessness of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirits, who fell away and discovered their own darkness, when bared</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the clothing of Thy light, dost Thou sufficiently reveal how</p>
<p class="calibre1">noble Thou madest the reasonable creature; to which nothing will</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffice to yield a happy rest, less than Thee; and so not even</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself. For Thou, O our God, shalt lighten our darkness: from Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">riseth our garment of light; and then shall our darkness be as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">noon day. Give Thyself unto me, O my God, restore Thyself unto me:</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold I love, and if it be too little, I would love more strongly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I cannot measure so as to know, how much love there yet lacketh to me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">ere my life may run into Thy embracements, nor turn away, until it</p>
<p class="calibre1">be hidden in the hidden place of Thy Presence. This only I know,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that woe is me except in Thee: not only without but within myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">also; and all abundance, which is not my God, is emptiness to me.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But was not either the Father, or the Son, borne above the waters?</p>
<p class="calibre1">if this means, in space, like a body, then neither was the Holy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit; but if the unchangeable supereminence of Divinity above all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things changeable, then were both Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost</p>
<p class="calibre1">borne upon the waters. Why then is this said of Thy Spirit only, why</p>
<p class="calibre1">is it said only of Him? As if He had been in place, Who is not in</p>
<p class="calibre1">place, of Whom only it is written, that He is Thy gift? In Thy Gift we</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest; there we enjoy Thee. Our rest is our place. Love lifts us up</p>
<p class="calibre1">thither, and Thy good Spirit lifts up our lowliness from the gates</p>
<p class="calibre1">of death. In Thy good pleasure is our peace. The body by its own</p>
<p class="calibre1">weight strives towards its own place. Weight makes not downward</p>
<p class="calibre1">only, but to his own place. Fire tends upward, a stone downward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They are urged by their own weight, they seek their own places. Oil</p>
<p class="calibre1">poured below water, is raised above the water; water poured upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">oil, sinks below the oil. They are urged by their own weights to</p>
<p class="calibre1">seek their own places. When out of their order, they are restless;</p>
<p class="calibre1">restored to order, they are at rest. My weight, is my love; thereby am</p>
<p class="calibre1">I borne, whithersoever I am borne. We are inflamed, by Thy Gift we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">kindled; and are carried upwards; we glow inwardly, and go forwards.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We ascend Thy ways that be in our heart, and sing a song of degrees;</p>
<p class="calibre1">we glow inwardly with Thy fire, with Thy good fire, and we go; because</p>
<p class="calibre1">we go upwards to the peace of Jerusalem: for gladdened was I in</p>
<p class="calibre1">those who said unto me, We will go up to the house of the Lord.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There hath Thy good pleasure placed us, that we may desire nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">else, but to abide there for ever.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blessed creature, which being itself other than Thou, has known no</p>
<p class="calibre1">other condition, than that, so soon as it was made, it was, without</p>
<p class="calibre1">any interval, by Thy Gift, Which is borne above every thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">changeable, borne aloft by that calling whereby Thou saidst, Let there</p>
<p class="calibre1">be light, and there was light. Whereas in us this took place at</p>
<p class="calibre1">different times, in that we were darkness, and are made light: but</p>
<p class="calibre1">of that is only said, what it would have been, had it not been</p>
<p class="calibre1">enlightened. And, this is so spoken, as if it had been unsettled and</p>
<p class="calibre1">darksome before; that so the cause whereby it was made otherwise,</p>
<p class="calibre1">might appear, namely, that being turned to the Light unfailing it</p>
<p class="calibre1">became light. Whoso can, let him understand this; let him ask of Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why should he trouble me, as if I could enlighten any man that</p>
<p class="calibre1">cometh into this world?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which of us comprehendeth the Almighty Trinity? and yet which speaks</p>
<p class="calibre1">not of It, if indeed it be It? Rare is the soul, which while it speaks</p>
<p class="calibre1">of It, knows what it speaks of. And they contend and strive, yet,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without peace, no man sees that vision. I would that men would</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider these three, that are in themselves. These three be indeed</p>
<p class="calibre1">far other than the Trinity: I do but tell, where they may practise</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves, and there prove and feel how far they be. Now the three</p>
<p class="calibre1">I spake of are, To Be, to Know, and to Will. For I Am, and Know, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Will: I Am Knowing and Willing: and I Know myself to Be, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Will: and I Will to Be, and to Know. In these three then, let him</p>
<p class="calibre1">discern that can, how inseparable a life there is, yea one life, mind,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and one essence, yea lastly how inseparable a distinction there is,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and yet a distinction. Surely a man hath it before him; let him look</p>
<p class="calibre1">into himself, and see, and tell me. But when he discovers and can</p>
<p class="calibre1">say any thing of these, let him not therefore think that he has</p>
<p class="calibre1">found that which is above these Unchangeable, which Is unchangeably,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Knows unchangeably, and Wills unchangeably; and whether because of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these three, there is in God also a Trinity, or whether all three be</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Each, so that the three belong to Each; or whether both ways at</p>
<p class="calibre1">once, wondrously, simply and yet manifoldly, Itself a bound unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Itself within Itself, yet unbounded; whereby It is, and is Known</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Itself and sufficeth to itself, unchangeably the Self-same, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the abundant greatness of its Unity, -who can readily conceive this?</p>
<p class="calibre1">who could any ways express it? who would, any way, pronounce thereon</p>
<p class="calibre1">rashly?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Proceed in thy confession, say to the Lord thy God, O my faith,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Holy, Holy, Holy, O Lord my God, in Thy Name have we been baptised,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; in Thy Name do we baptise, Father, Son,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Holy Ghost, because among us also, in His Christ did God make</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and earth, namely, the spiritual and carnal people of His</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church. Yea and our earth, before it received the form of doctrine,</p>
<p class="calibre1">was invisible and without form; and we were covered with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness of ignorance. For Thou chastenedst man for iniquity, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy judgments were like the great deep unto him. But because Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit was borne above the waters, Thy mercy forsook not our misery,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Thou saidst, Let there be light, Repent ye, for the kingdom of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven is at hand. Repent ye, let there be light. And because our soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">was troubled within us, we remembered Thee, O Lord, from the land of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordan, and that mountain equal unto Thyself, but little for our</p>
<p class="calibre1">sakes: and our darkness displeased us, we turned unto Thee and there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was light. And, behold, we were sometimes darkness, but now light in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lord.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as yet by faith and not by sight, for by hope we are saved;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but hope that is seen, is not hope. As yet doth deep call unto deep,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but now in the voice of Thy water-spouts. As yet doth he that saith, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">he as yet, doth not think himself to have apprehended, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgetteth those things which are behind, and reacheth forth to</p>
<p class="calibre1">those which are before, and groaneth being burthened, and his soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirsteth after the Living God, as the hart after the water-brooks,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and saith, When shall I come? desiring to be clothed upon with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">house which is from heaven, and calleth upon this lower deep,</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying, Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">renewing of your mind. And, be not children in understanding, but in</p>
<p class="calibre1">malice, be ye children, that in understanding ye may be perfect; and O</p>
<p class="calibre1">foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you? But now no longer in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own voice; but in Thine who sentest Thy Spirit from above; through Him</p>
<p class="calibre1">who ascended up on high, and set open the flood-gates of His gifts,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the force of His streams might make glad the city of God. Him</p>
<p class="calibre1">doth this friend of the Bridegroom sigh after, having now the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first-fruits of the Spirit laid up with Him, yet still groaning within</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of his body;</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Him he sighs, a member of the Bride; for Him he is jealous, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">being a friend of the Bridegroom; for Him he is jealous, not for</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself; because in the voice of Thy water-spouts, not in his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice, doth he call to that other depth, over whom being jealous he</p>
<p class="calibre1">feareth, lest as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">their minds should be corrupted from the purity that is in our</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bridegroom Thy only Son. O what a light of beauty will that be, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we shall see Him as He is, and those tears be passed away, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">have been my meat day and night, whilst they daily say unto me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Where is now Thy God?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold, I too say, O my God, Where art Thou? see, where Thou art! in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee I breathe a little, when I pour out my soul by myself in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice of joy and praise, the sound of him that keeps holy-day. And yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">again it is sad, because it relapseth, and becomes a deep, or rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceives itself still to be a deep. Unto it speaks my faith which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast kindled to enlighten my feet in the night, Why art thou sad,</p>
<p class="calibre1">O my soul, and why dost thou trouble me? Hope in the Lord; His word is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a lanthorn unto thy feet: hope and endure, until the night, the mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the wicked, until the wrath of the Lord, be overpast, whereof we</p>
<p class="calibre1">also were once children, who were sometimes darkness, relics whereof</p>
<p class="calibre1">we bear about us in our body, dead because of sin; until the day</p>
<p class="calibre1">break, and the shadows fly away. Hope thou in the Lord; in the morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">I shall stand in Thy presence, and contemplate Thee: I shall for</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever confess unto Thee. In the morning I shall stand in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence, and shall see the health of my countenance, my God, who also</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall quicken our mortal bodies, by the Spirit that dwelleth in us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because He hath in mercy been borne over our inner darksome and</p>
<p class="calibre1">floating deep: from Whom we have in this pilgrimage received an</p>
<p class="calibre1">earnest, that we should now be light: whilst we are saved by hope, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">are the children of light, and the children of the day, not the</p>
<p class="calibre1">children of the night, nor of the darkness, which yet sometimes we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were. Betwixt whom and us, in this uncertainty of human knowledge,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou only dividest; Thou, who provest our hearts, and callest the</p>
<p class="calibre1">light, day, and the darkness, night. For who discerneth us, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou? And what have we, that we have not received of Thee? out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same lump vessels are made unto honour, whereof others also are</p>
<p class="calibre1">made unto dishonour.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or who, except Thou, our God, made for us that firmament of</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority over us in Thy Divine Scripture? as it is said, For heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall be folded up like a scroll; and now is it stretched over us like</p>
<p class="calibre1">a skin. For Thy Divine Scripture is of more eminent authority, since</p>
<p class="calibre1">those mortals by whom Thou dispensest it unto us, underwent mortality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And Thou knowest, Lord, Thou knowest, how Thou with skins didst clothe</p>
<p class="calibre1">men, when they by sin became mortal. Whence Thou hast like a skin</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretched out the firmament of Thy book, that is, Thy harmonizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">words, which by the ministry of mortal men Thou spreadest over us. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">by their very death was that solid firmament of authority, in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">discourses set forth by them, more eminently extended over all that be</p>
<p class="calibre1">under it; which whilst they lived here, was not so eminently extended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hadst not as yet spread abroad the heaven like a skin; Thou hadst</p>
<p class="calibre1">not as yet enlarged in all directions the glory of their deaths.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let us look, O Lord, upon the heavens, the work of Thy fingers;</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear from our eyes that cloud, which Thou hast spread under them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is Thy testimony, which giveth wisdom unto the little ones:</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfect, O my God, Thy praise out of the mouth of babes and sucklings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For we know no other books, which so destroy pride, which so destroy</p>
<p class="calibre1">the enemy and the defender, who resisteth Thy reconciliation by</p>
<p class="calibre1">defending his own sins. I know not, Lord, I know not any other such</p>
<p class="calibre1">pure words, which so persuade me to confess, and make my neck pliant</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thy yoke, and invite me to serve Thee for nought. Let me understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, good Father: grant this to me, who am placed under them: because</p>
<p class="calibre1">for those placed under them, hast Thou established them.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other waters there be above this firmament, I believe immortal,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and separated from earthly corruption. Let them praise Thy Name, let</p>
<p class="calibre1">them praise Thee, the supercelestial people, Thine angels, who have no</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to gaze up at this firmament, or by reading to know of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Word. For they always behold Thy face, and there read without any</p>
<p class="calibre1">syllables in time, what willeth Thy eternal will; they read, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">choose, they love. They are ever reading; and that never passes away</p>
<p class="calibre1">which they read; for by choosing, and by loving, they read the very</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchangeableness of Thy counsel. Their book is never closed, nor their</p>
<p class="calibre1">scroll folded up; seeing Thou Thyself art this to them, and art</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternally; because Thou hast ordained them above this firmament, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast firmly settled over the infirmity of the lower people, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">they might gaze up and learn Thy mercy, announcing in time Thee Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">madest times. For Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth reacheth unto the clouds. The clouds pass away, but the heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">abideth. The preachers of Thy word pass out of this life into another;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but Thy Scripture is spread abroad over the people, even unto the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of the world. Yet heaven and earth also shall pass away, but Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">words shall not pass away. Because the scroll shall be rolled</p>
<p class="calibre1">together: and the grass over which it was spread, shall with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">goodliness of it pass away; but Thy Word remaineth for ever, which now</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeareth unto us under the dark image of the clouds, and through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the glass of the heavens, not as it is: because we also, though the</p>
<p class="calibre1">well-beloved of Thy Son, yet it hath not yet appeared what we shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">be. He looketh through the lattice of our flesh, and He spake us</p>
<p class="calibre1">tenderly, and kindled us, and we ran after His odours. But when He</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall appear, then shall we be like Him, for we shall see Him as He</p>
<p class="calibre1">is. As He is, Lord, will our sight be.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For altogether, as Thou art, Thou only knowest; Who art</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchangeably, and knowest unchangeably, and willest unchangeably.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And Thy Essence Knoweth, and Willeth unchangeably; and Thy Knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre1">Is, and Willeth unchangeably; and Thy Will Is, and Knoweth</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchangeably. Nor seemeth it right in Thine eyes, that as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unchangeable Light knoweth Itself, so should it be known by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing enlightened, and changeable. Therefore is my soul like a land</p>
<p class="calibre1">where no water is, because as it cannot of itself enlighten itself, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">can it not of itself satisfy itself. For so is the fountain of life</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Thee, like as in Thy light we shall see light.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who gathered the embittered together into one society? For they have</p>
<p class="calibre1">all one end, a temporal and earthly felicity, for attaining whereof</p>
<p class="calibre1">they do all things, though they waver up and down with an</p>
<p class="calibre1">innumerable variety of cares. Who, Lord, but Thou, saidst, Let the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear, which thirsteth after Thee? For the sea also is Thine, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast made it, and Thy hands prepared the dry land. Nor is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bitterness of men’s wills, but the gathering together of the waters,</p>
<p class="calibre1">called sea; for Thou restrainest the wicked desires of men’s souls,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and settest them their bounds, how far they may be allowed to pass,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that their waves may break one against another: and thus makest Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">it a sea, by the order of Thy dominion over all things.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the souls that thirst after Thee, and that appear before Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">(being by other bounds divided from the society of the sea), Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">waterest by a sweet spring, that the earth may bring forth her</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruit, and Thou, Lord God, so commanding, our soul may bud forth works</p>
<p class="calibre1">of mercy according to their kind, loving our neighbour in the relief</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his bodily necessities, having seed in itself according to its</p>
<p class="calibre1">likeness, when from feeling of our infirmity, we compassionate so as</p>
<p class="calibre1">to relieve the needy; helping them, as we would be helped; if we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were in like need; not only in things easy, as in herb yielding</p>
<p class="calibre1">seed, but also in the protection of our assistance, with our best</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength, like the tree yielding fruit: that is, well-doing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">rescuing him that suffers wrong, from the hand of the powerful, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">giving him the shelter of protection, by the mighty strength of just</p>
<p class="calibre1">judgment.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, Lord, so, I beseech Thee, let there spring up, as Thou doest, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou givest cheerfulness and ability, let truth spring out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth, and righteousness look down from heaven, and let there be</p>
<p class="calibre1">lights in the firmament. Let us break our bread to the hungry, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bring the houseless poor to our house. Let us clothe the naked, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">despise not those of our own flesh. Which fruits having sprung out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the earth, see it is good: and let our temporary light break forth;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ourselves, from this lower fruitfulness of action, arriving at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">delightfulness of contemplation, obtaining the Word of Life above,</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear like lights in the world, cleaving to the firmament of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scripture. For there Thou instructest us, to divide between the things</p>
<p class="calibre1">intellectual, and things of sense, as betwixt the day and the night;</p>
<p class="calibre1">or between souls, given either to things intellectual, or things of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense, so that now not Thou only in the secret of Thy judgment, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">before the firmament was made, dividest between the light and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness, but Thy spiritual children also set and ranked in the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">firmament (now that Thy grace is laid open throughout the world),</p>
<p class="calibre1">may give light upon the earth, and divide betwixt the day and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night, and be for signs of times, that old things are passed away,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and, behold, all things are become new; and that our salvation is</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearer than when we believed: and that the night is far spent, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day is at hand: and that Thou wilt crown Thy year with blessing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sending the labourers of Thy goodness into Thy harvest, in sowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereof, others have laboured, sending also into another field,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose harvest shall be in the end. Thus grantest Thou the prayers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">him that asketh, and blessest the years of the just; but Thou art</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same, and in Thy years which fail not, Thou preparest a garner for</p>
<p class="calibre1">our passing years. For Thou by an eternal counsel dost in their proper</p>
<p class="calibre1">seasons bestow heavenly blessings upon the earth. For to one is</p>
<p class="calibre1">given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, as it were the lesser light:</p>
<p class="calibre1">to another faith; to another the gift with the light of perspicuous</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth, as it were for the rule of the day. To another the word of</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge by the same Spirit, as it were the lesser light: to</p>
<p class="calibre1">another faith; to another the gift of healing; to another the</p>
<p class="calibre1">working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues. And all these as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were stars. For all these worketh the one and self-same spirit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">dividing to every man his own as He will; and causing stars to</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear manifestly, to profit withal. But the word of knowledge,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherein are contained all Sacraments, which are varied in their</p>
<p class="calibre1">seasons as it were the moon, and those other notices of gifts, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">are reckoned up in order, as it were stars, inasmuch as they come</p>
<p class="calibre1">short of that brightness of wisdom, which gladdens the forementioned</p>
<p class="calibre1">day, are only for the rule of the night. For they are necessary to</p>
<p class="calibre1">such, as that Thy most prudent servant could not speak unto as unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual, but as unto carnal; even he, who speaketh wisdom among</p>
<p class="calibre1">those that are perfect. But the natural man, as it were a babe in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ and fed on milk, until he be strengthened for solid meat and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his eye be enabled to behold the Sun, let him not dwell in a night</p>
<p class="calibre1">forsaken of all light, but be content with the light of the moon and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the stars. So dost Thou speak to us, our All-wise God, in Thy Book,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy firmament; that we may discern all things, in an admirable</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemplation; though as yet in signs and in times, and in days, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in years.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But first, wash you, be clean; put away evil from your souls, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">from before mine eyes, that the dry land may appear. Learn to do good,</p>
<p class="calibre1">judge the fatherless, plead for the widow, that the earth may bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth the green herb for meat, and the tree bearing fruit; and come,</p>
<p class="calibre1">let us reason together, saith the Lord, that there may be lights in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the firmament of the heaven, and they may shine upon the earth. That</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich man asked of the good Master, what he should do to attain eternal</p>
<p class="calibre1">life. Let the good Master tell him (whom he thought no more than</p>
<p class="calibre1">man; but He is good because He is God), let Him tell him, if he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would enter into life, he must keep the commandments: let him put away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from him the bitterness of malice and wickedness; not kill, not commit</p>
<p class="calibre1">adultery, not steal, not bear false witness; that the dry land may</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear, and bring forth the honouring of father and mother, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">love of our neighbour. All these (saith he) have I kept. Whence then</p>
<p class="calibre1">so many thorns, if the earth be fruitful? Go, root up the spreading</p>
<p class="calibre1">thickets of covetousness; sell that thou hast, and be filled with</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruit, by giving to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven; and follow the Lord if thou wilt be perfect, associated with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, among whom He speaketh wisdom, Who knoweth what to distribute to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the day, and to the night, that thou also mayest know it, and for thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">there may be lights in the firmament of heaven; which will not be,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless thy heart be there: nor will that either be, unless there thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">treasure be; as thou hast heard of the good Master. But that barren</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth was grieved; and the thorns choked the word.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But you, chosen generation, you weak things of the world, who have</p>
<p class="calibre1">forsaken all, that ye may follow the Lord; go after Him, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">confound the mighty; go after Him, ye beautiful feet, and shine ye</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the firmament, that the heavens may declare His glory, dividing</p>
<p class="calibre1">between the light of the perfect, though not as the angels, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness of the little ones, though not despised. Shine over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth; and let the day, lightened by the sun, utter unto day, speech</p>
<p class="calibre1">of wisdom; and night, shining with the moon, show unto night, the word</p>
<p class="calibre1">of knowledge. The moon and stars shine for the night; yet doth not the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night obscure them, seeing they give it light in its degree. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold God saying, as it were, Let there be lights in the firmament of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven; there came suddenly a sound from heaven, as it had been the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushing of a mighty wind, and there appeared cloven tongues like as of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire, and it sat upon each of them. And there were made lights in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the firmament of heaven, having the word of life. Run ye to and fro</p>
<p class="calibre1">every where, ye holy fires, ye beauteous fires; for ye are the light</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the world, nor are ye put under a bushel; He whom you cleave</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto, is exalted, and hath exalted you. Run ye to and fro, and be</p>
<p class="calibre1">known unto all nations.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let the sea also conceive and bring forth your works; and let the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters bring forth the moving creature that hath life. For ye,</p>
<p class="calibre1">separating the precious from the vile, are made the mouth of God, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom He saith, Let the waters bring forth, not the living creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">which the earth brings forth, but the moving creature having life, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fowls that fly above the earth. For Thy Sacraments, O God, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ministry of Thy holy ones, have moved amid the waves of</p>
<p class="calibre1">temptations of the world, to hallow the Gentiles in Thy Name, in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Baptism. And amid these things, many great wonders were wrought, as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were great whales: and the voices of Thy messengers flying above the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth, in the open firmament of Thy Book; that being set over them, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">their authority under which they were to fly, whithersoever they went.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For there is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard:</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing their sound is gone through all the earth, and their words to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of the world, because Thou, Lord, multipliedst them by</p>
<p class="calibre1">blessing.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speak I untruly, or do I mingle and confound, and not distinguish</p>
<p class="calibre1">between the lucid knowledge of these things in the firmament of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven, and the material works in the wavy sea, and under the</p>
<p class="calibre1">firmament of heaven? For of those things whereof the knowledge is</p>
<p class="calibre1">substantial and defined, without any increase by generation, as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were lights of wisdom and knowledge, yet even of them, the material</p>
<p class="calibre1">operations are many and divers; and one thing growing out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">another, they are multiplied by Thy blessing, O God, who hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">refreshed the fastidiousness of mortal senses; that so one thing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the understanding of our mind, may, by the motions of the body, be</p>
<p class="calibre1">many ways set out, and expressed. These Sacraments have the waters</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought forth; but in Thy word. The necessities of the people</p>
<p class="calibre1">estranged from the eternity of Thy truth, have brought them forth, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thy Gospel; because the waters themselves cast them forth, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">diseased bitterness whereof was the cause, why they were sent forth in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy Word.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now are all things fair that Thou hast made; but behold, Thyself art</p>
<p class="calibre1">unutterably fairer, that madest all; from whom had not Adam fallen,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the brackishness of the sea had never flowed out of him, that is,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the human race so profoundly curious, and tempestuously swelling,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and restlessly tumbling up and down; and then had there been no need</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thy dispensers to work in many waters, after a corporeal and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensible manner, mysterious doings and sayings. For such those</p>
<p class="calibre1">moving and flying creatures now seem to me to mean, whereby people</p>
<p class="calibre1">being initiated and consecrated by corporeal Sacraments, should not</p>
<p class="calibre1">further profit, unless their soul had a spiritual life, and unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">after the word of admission, it looked forwards to perfection.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And hereby, in Thy Word, not the deepness of the sea, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth separated from the bitterness of the waters, brings forth, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the moving creature that hath life, but the living soul. For now</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath it no more need of baptism, as the heathen have, and as itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">had, when it was covered with the waters; (for no other entrance is</p>
<p class="calibre1">there into the kingdom of heaven, since Thou hast appointed that</p>
<p class="calibre1">this should be the entrance:) nor does it seek after wonderfulness</p>
<p class="calibre1">of miracles to work belief; for it is not such, that unless it sees</p>
<p class="calibre1">signs and wonders, it will not believe, now that the faithful earth is</p>
<p class="calibre1">separated from the waters that were bitter with infidelity; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe not. Neither then does that earth which Thou hast founded upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the waters, need that flying kind, which at Thy word the waters</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought forth. Send Thou Thy word into it by Thy messengers: for we</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak of their working, yet it is Thou that workest in them that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they may work out a living soul in it. The earth brings it forth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because the earth is the cause that they work this in the soul; as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea was the cause that they wrought upon the moving creatures that</p>
<p class="calibre1">have life, and the fowls that fly under the firmament of heaven, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom the earth hath no need; although it feeds upon that fish which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was taken out of the deep, upon that table which Thou hast prepared in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the presence of them that believe. For therefore was He taken out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the deep, that He might feed the dry land; and the fowl, though bred</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the sea, is yet multiplied upon the earth. For of the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">preachings of the Evangelists, man’s infidelity was the cause; yet are</p>
<p class="calibre1">the faithful also exhorted and blessed by them manifoldly, from day to</p>
<p class="calibre1">day. But the living soul takes his beginning from the earth: for it</p>
<p class="calibre1">profits only those already among the Faithful, to contain themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the love of this world, that so their soul may live unto Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which was dead while it lived in pleasures; in death-bringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasures, Lord, for Thou, Lord, art the life-giving delight of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pure heart.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now then let Thy ministers work upon the earth, -not as upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters of infidelity, by preaching and speaking by miracles, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sacraments, and mystic words; wherein ignorance, the mother of</p>
<p class="calibre1">admiration, might be intent upon them, out of a reverence towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">those secret signs. For such is the entrance unto the Faith for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sons of Adam forgetful of Thee, while they hide themselves from Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">face, and become a darksome deep. But-let Thy ministers work now as</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the dry land, separated from the whirlpools of the great deep:</p>
<p class="calibre1">and let them be a pattern unto the Faithful, by living before them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and stirring them up to imitation. For thus do men hear, so as not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to hear only, but to do also. Seek the Lord, and your soul shall live,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the earth may bring forth the living soul. Be not conformed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world. Contain yourselves from it: the soul lives by avoiding what</p>
<p class="calibre1">it dies by affecting. Contain yourselves from the ungoverned</p>
<p class="calibre1">wildness of pride, the sluggish voluptuousness of luxury, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">false name of knowledge: that so the wild beasts may be tamed, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cattle broken to the yoke, the serpents, harmless. For these be the</p>
<p class="calibre1">motions of our mind under an allegory; that is to say, the haughtiness</p>
<p class="calibre1">of pride, the delight of lust, and the poison of curiosity, are the</p>
<p class="calibre1">motions of a dead soul; for the soul dies not so as to lose all</p>
<p class="calibre1">motion; because it dies by forsaking the fountain of life, and so is</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken up by this transitory world, and is conformed unto it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Thy word, O God, is the fountain of life eternal; and passeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">not away: wherefore this departure of the soul is restrained by Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">word, when it is said unto us, Be not conformed unto this world;</p>
<p class="calibre1">that so the earth may in the fountain of life bring forth a living</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul; that is, a soul made continent in Thy Word, by Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Evangelists, by following the followers of Thy Christ. For this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">after his kind; because a man is wont to imitate his friend. Be ye</p>
<p class="calibre1">(saith he) as I am, for I also am as you are. Thus in this living soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall there be good beasts, in meekness of action (for Thou hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanded, Go on with thy business in meekness, so shalt thou be</p>
<p class="calibre1">beloved by all men); and good cattle, which neither if they eat, shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">they over-abound, nor, if they eat not, have any lack; and good</p>
<p class="calibre1">serpents, not dangerous, to do hurt, but wise to take heed; and only</p>
<p class="calibre1">making so much search into this temporal nature, as may suffice that</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternity be clearly seen, being understood by the things that are</p>
<p class="calibre1">made. For these creatures are obedient unto reason, when being</p>
<p class="calibre1">restrained from deadly prevailing upon us, they live, and are good.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For behold, O Lord, our God, our Creator, when our affections have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been restrained from the love of the world, by which we died through</p>
<p class="calibre1">evil-living; and begun to be a living soul, through good living; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy word which Thou spokest by Thy apostle, is made good in us, Be not</p>
<p class="calibre1">conformed to this world: there follows that also, which Thou presently</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjoinedst, saying, But be ye transformed by the renewing of your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind; not now after your kind, as though following your neighbour</p>
<p class="calibre1">who went before you, nor as living after the example of some better</p>
<p class="calibre1">man (for Thou saidst not, “Let man be made after his kind,” but, Let</p>
<p class="calibre1">us make man after our own image and similitude), that we might prove</p>
<p class="calibre1">what Thy will is. For to this purpose said that dispenser of Thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">(who begat children by the Gospel), that he might not for ever have</p>
<p class="calibre1">them babes, whom he must be fain to feed with milk, and cherish as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nurse; be ye transformed (saith he) by the renewing of your mind, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wherefore Thou sayest not, “Let man be made,” but Let us make man. Nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">saidst Thou, “according to his kind”; but, after our image and</p>
<p class="calibre1">likeness. For man being renewed in his mind, and beholding and</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding Thy truth, needs not man as his director, so as to</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow after his kind; but by Thy direction proveth what is that good,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that acceptable, and perfect will of Thine: yea, Thou teachest him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">now made capable, to discern the Trinity of the Unity, and the Unity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Trinity. Wherefore to that said in the plural. Let us make man,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is yet subjoined in the singular, And God made man: and to that said</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the plural. After our likeness, is subjoined in the singular, After</p>
<p class="calibre1">the image of God. Thus is man renewed in the knowledge of God, after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the image of Him that created him: and being made spiritual, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">judgeth all things (all things which are to be judged), yet himself is</p>
<p class="calibre1">judged of no man.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that he judgeth all things, this answers to his having</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowls of the air,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and over all cattle and wild beasts, and over all the earth, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. For this he</p>
<p class="calibre1">doth by the understanding of his mind, whereby he perceiveth the</p>
<p class="calibre1">things of the Spirit of God; whereas otherwise, man being placed in</p>
<p class="calibre1">honour, had no understanding, and is compared unto the brute beasts,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and is become like unto them. In Thy Church therefore, O our God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to Thy grace which Thou hast bestowed upon it (for we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy workmanship created unto good works), not those only who are</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritually set over, but they also who spiritually are subject to</p>
<p class="calibre1">those that are set over them, -for in this way didst Thou make man</p>
<p class="calibre1">male and female, in Thy grace spiritual, where, according to the sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">of body, there is neither male nor female, because neither Jew nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grecian, neither bond nor free. -Spiritual persons (whether such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">are set over, or such as obey); do judge spiritually; not of that</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual knowledge which shines in the firmament (for they ought</p>
<p class="calibre1">not to judge as to so supreme authority), nor may they judge of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Book itself, even though something there shineth not clearly; for we</p>
<p class="calibre1">submit our understanding unto it, and hold for certain, that even what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is closed to our sight, is yet rightly and truly spoken. For so man,</p>
<p class="calibre1">though now spiritual and renewed in the knowledge of God after His</p>
<p class="calibre1">image that created him, ought to be a doer of the law, not a judge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither doth he judge of that distinction of spiritual and carnal men,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who are known unto Thine eyes, O our God, and have not as yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered themselves unto us by works, that by their fruits we</p>
<p class="calibre1">might know them: but Thou, Lord, dost even now know them, and hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">divided and called them in secret, or ever the firmament was made. Nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">doth he, though spiritual, judge the unquiet people of this world; for</p>
<p class="calibre1">what hath he to do, to judge them that are without, knowing not</p>
<p class="calibre1">which of them shall hereafter come into the sweetness of Thy grace;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and which continue in the perpetual bitterness of ungodliness?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Man therefore, whom Thou hast made after Thine own image, received</p>
<p class="calibre1">not dominion over the lights of heaven, nor over that hidden heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself, nor over the day and the night, which Thou calledst before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">foundation of the heaven, nor over the gathering together of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters, which is the sea; but He received dominion over the fishes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and over all cattle, and over</p>
<p class="calibre1">all the earth, and over all creeping things which creep upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth. For He judgeth and approveth what He findeth right, and He</p>
<p class="calibre1">disalloweth what He findeth amiss, whether in the celebration of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sacraments by which such are initiated, as Thy mercy searches out in</p>
<p class="calibre1">many waters: or in that, in which that Fish is set forth, which, taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the deep, the devout earth feedeth upon: or in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">expressions and signs of words, subject to the authority of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Book, -such signs, as proceed out of the mouth, and sound forth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">flying as it were under the firmament, by interpreting, expounding,</p>
<p class="calibre1">discoursing disputing, consecrating, or praying unto Thee, so that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">people may answer, Amen. The vocal pronouncing of all which words,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is occasioned by the deep of this world, and the blindness of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh, which cannot see thoughts; So that there is need to speak aloud</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the ears; so that, although flying fowls be multiplied upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth, yet they derive their beginning from the waters. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual man judgeth also by allowing of what is right, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">disallowing what he finds amiss, in the works and lives of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful; their alms, as it were the earth bringing forth fruit, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the living soul, living by the taming of the affections, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">chastity, in fasting, in holy meditations; and of those things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which are perceived by the senses of the body. Upon all these is he</p>
<p class="calibre1">now said to judge, wherein he hath also power of correction.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what is this, and what kind of mystery? Behold, Thou blessest</p>
<p class="calibre1">mankind, O Lord, that they may increase and multiply, and replenish</p>
<p class="calibre1">the earth; dost Thou not thereby give us a hint to understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">something? why didst Thou not as well bless the light, which Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">calledst day; nor the firmament of heaven, nor the lights, nor the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stars, nor the earth, nor the sea? I might say that Thou, O God, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">created created us after Thine Image, I might say, that it had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy good pleasure to bestow this blessing peculiarly upon man; hadst</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou not in like manner blessed the fishes and the whales, that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">should increase and multiply, and replenish the waters of the sea, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the fowls should be multiplied upon the earth. I might say</p>
<p class="calibre1">likewise, that this blessing pertained properly unto such creatures,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as are bred of their own kind, had I found it given to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruit-trees, and plants, and beasts of the earth. But now neither unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the herbs, nor the trees, nor the beasts, nor serpents is it said,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Increase and multiply; notwithstanding all these as well as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fishes, fowls, or men, do by generation increase and continue their</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then shall I say, O Truth my Light? “that it was idly said, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">without meaning?” Not so, O Father of piety, far he it from a minister</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thy word to say so. And if I understand not what Thou meanest by</p>
<p class="calibre1">that phrase, let my betters, that is, those of more understanding than</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself, make better use of it, according as Thou, my God, hast given</p>
<p class="calibre1">to each man to understand. But let my confession also be pleasing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thine eyes, wherein I confess unto Thee, that I believe, O Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Thou spokest not so in vain; nor will I suppress, what this</p>
<p class="calibre1">lesson suggests to me. For it is true, nor do I see what should hinder</p>
<p class="calibre1">me from thus understanding the figurative sayings of Thy Bible. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know a thing to be manifoldly signified by corporeal expressions,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is understood one way by the mind; and that understood many ways</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the mind, which is signified one way by corporeal expression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold, the single love of God and our neighbour, by what manifold</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacraments, and innumerable languages, and in each several language,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in how innumerable modes of speaking, it is corporeally expressed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus do the offspring of the waters increase and multiply. Observe</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, whosoever readest this; behold, what Scripture delivers, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the voice pronounces one only way, In the Beginning God created heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">and earth; is it not understood manifoldly, not through any deceit</p>
<p class="calibre1">of error, but by various kinds of true senses? Thus do man’s offspring</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase and multiply.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">If therefore we conceive of the natures of the things themselves,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not allegorically, but properly, then does the phrase increase and</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiply, agree unto all things, that come of seed. But if we treat of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the words as figuratively spoken (which I rather suppose to be the</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose of the Scripture, which doth not, surely, superfluously</p>
<p class="calibre1">ascribe this benediction to the offspring of aquatic animals and man</p>
<p class="calibre1">only); then do we find “multitude” to belong to creatures spiritual as</p>
<p class="calibre1">well as corporeal, as in heaven and earth, and to righteous and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unrighteous, as in light and darkness; and to holy authors who have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been the ministers of the Law unto us, as in the firmament which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">settled betwixt the waters and the waters; and to the society of</p>
<p class="calibre1">people yet in the bitterness of infidelity, as in the sea; and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the zeal of holy souls, as in the dry land; and to works of mercy</p>
<p class="calibre1">belonging to this present life, as in the herbs bearing seed, and in</p>
<p class="calibre1">trees bearing fruit; and to spiritual gifts set forth for edification,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as in the lights of heaven; and to affections formed unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">temperance, as in the living soul. In all these instances we meet with</p>
<p class="calibre1">multitudes, abundance, and increase; but what shall in such wise</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase and multiply that one thing may be expressed many ways, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">one expression understood many ways; we find not, except in signs</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporeally expressed, and in things mentally conceived. By signs</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporeally pronounced we understand the generations of the waters,</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessarily occasioned by the depth of the flesh; by things mentally</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceived, human generations, on account of the fruitfulness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason. And for this end do we believe Thee, Lord, to have said to</p>
<p class="calibre1">these kinds, Increase and multiply. For in this blessing, I conceive</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee to have granted us a power and a faculty, both to express several</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways what we understand but one; and to understand several ways,</p>
<p class="calibre1">what we read to be obscurely delivered but in one. Thus are the waters</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the sea replenished, which are not moved but by several</p>
<p class="calibre1">significations: thus with human increase is the earth also</p>
<p class="calibre1">replenished, whose dryness appeareth in its longing, and reason ruleth</p>
<p class="calibre1">over it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I would also say, O Lord my God, what the following Scripture</p>
<p class="calibre1">minds me of; yea, I will say, and not fear. For I will say the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth, Thyself inspiring me with what Thou willedst me to deliver</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of those words. But by no other inspiration than Thine, do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe myself to speak truth, seeing Thou art the Truth, and every</p>
<p class="calibre1">man a liar. He therefore that speaketh a lie, speaketh of his own;</p>
<p class="calibre1">that therefore I may speak truth, I will speak of Thine. Behold,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast given unto us for food every herb bearing seed which is upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">all the earth; and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree</p>
<p class="calibre1">yielding seed. And not to us alone, but also to all the fowls of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air, and to the beasts of the earth, and to all creeping things; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto the fishes and to the great whales, hast Thou not given them. Now</p>
<p class="calibre1">we said that by these fruits of the earth were signified, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">figured in an allegory, the works of mercy which are provided for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the necessities of this life out of the fruitful earth. Such an</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth was the devout Onesiphorus, unto whose house Thou gavest</p>
<p class="calibre1">mercy, because he often refreshed Thy Paul, and was not ashamed of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chain. Thus did also the brethren, and such fruit did they bear, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of Macedonia supplied what was lacking to him. But how grieved</p>
<p class="calibre1">he for some trees, which did not afford him the fruit due unto him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">where he saith, At my first answer no man stood by me, but all men</p>
<p class="calibre1">forsook me. I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">these fruits are due to such as minister the spiritual doctrine unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">us out of their understanding of the divine mysteries; and they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">due to them, as men; yea and due to them also, as the living soul,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which giveth itself as an example, in all continency; and due unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">them also, as flying creatures, for their blessings which are</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiplied upon the earth, because their sound went out into all</p>
<p class="calibre1">lands.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they are fed by these fruits, that are delighted with them;</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor are they delighted with them, whose God is their belly. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither in them that yield them, are the things yielded the fruit, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">with what mind they yield them. He therefore that served God, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not his own belly, I plainly see why he rejoiced; I see it, and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejoice with him. For he had received from the Philippians, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they had sent by Epaphroditus unto him: and yet I perceive why he</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejoiced. For whereat he rejoiced upon that he fed; for, speaking in</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth, I rejoiced (saith he) greatly in the Lord, that now at the last</p>
<p class="calibre1">your care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were also careful,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but it had become wearisome unto you. These Philippians then had now</p>
<p class="calibre1">dried up, with a long weariness, and withered as it were as to bearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">this fruit of a good work; and he rejoiceth for them, that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">flourished again, not for himself, that they supplied his wants.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore subjoins he, not that I speak in respect of want, for I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both</p>
<p class="calibre1">how to be abased, and I know how to abound; every where and in all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things I am instructed both to be full, and to be hungry; both to</p>
<p class="calibre1">abound, and to suffer need. I can do all things through Him which</p>
<p class="calibre1">strengtheneth me.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereat then rejoicest thou, O great Paul? whereat rejoicest thou?</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereon feedest thou, O man, renewed in the knowledge of God, after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the image of Him that created thee, thou living soul, of so much</p>
<p class="calibre1">continency, thou tongue like flying fowls, speaking mysteries? (for to</p>
<p class="calibre1">such creatures, is this food due;) what is it that feeds thee? joy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hear we what follows: notwithstanding, ye have well done, that ye</p>
<p class="calibre1">did communicate with my affliction. Hereat he rejoiceth, hereon</p>
<p class="calibre1">feedeth; because they had well done, not because his strait was eased,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who saith unto Thee, Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; for</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he knew to abound, and to suffer want, in Thee Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">strengthenest him. For ye Philippians also know (saith he), that in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye</p>
<p class="calibre1">only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessity. Unto these good works, he now rejoiceth that they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned; and is gladdened that they flourished again, as when a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruitful field resumes its green.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was it for his own necessities, because he said, Ye sent unto my</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessity? Rejoiceth he for that? Verily not for that. But how know we</p>
<p class="calibre1">this? Because himself says immediately, not because I desire a gift,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but I desire fruit. I have learned of Thee, my God, to distinguish</p>
<p class="calibre1">betwixt a gift, and fruit. A gift, is the thing itself which he gives,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that imparts these necessaries unto us; as money, meat, drink,</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothing, shelter, help: but the fruit, is the good and right will</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the giver. For the Good Master said not only, He that receiveth a</p>
<p class="calibre1">prophet, but added, in the name of a prophet: nor did He only say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">He that receiveth a righteous man, but added, in the name of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">righteous man. So verily shall the one receive the reward of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">prophet, the other, the reward of a righteous man: nor saith He</p>
<p class="calibre1">only, He that shall give to drink a cup of cold water to one of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">little ones; but added, in the name of a disciple: and so</p>
<p class="calibre1">concludeth, Verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">gift is, to receive a prophet, to receive a righteous man, to give a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cup of cold water to a disciple: but the fruit, to do this in the name</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a prophet, in the name of a righteous man, in the name of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">disciple. With fruit was Elijah fed by the widow that knew she fed a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man of God, and therefore fed him: but by the raven was he fed with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a gift. Nor was the inner man of Elijah so fed, but the outer only;</p>
<p class="calibre1">which might also for want of that food have perished.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I will then speak what is true in Thy sight, O Lord, that when</p>
<p class="calibre1">carnal men and infidels (for the gaining and initiating whom, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">initiatory Sacraments and the mighty workings of miracles are</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary, which we suppose to be signified by the name of fishes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and whales) undertake the bodily refreshment, or otherwise succour Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servant with something useful for this present life; whereas they be</p>
<p class="calibre1">ignorant, why this is to be done, and to what end; neither do they</p>
<p class="calibre1">feed these, nor are these fed by them; because neither do the one do</p>
<p class="calibre1">it out of an holy and right intent; nor do the other rejoice at</p>
<p class="calibre1">their gifts, whose fruit they as yet behold not. For upon that is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mind fed, of which it is glad. And therefore do not the fishes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whales feed upon such meats, as the earth brings not forth until after</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was separated and divided from the bitterness of the waves of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Thou, O God, sawest every thing that Thou hadst made, and,</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold, it was very good. Yea we also see the same, and behold, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things are very good. Of the several kinds of Thy works, when Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadst said “let them be,” and they were, Thou sawest each that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was good. Seven times have I counted it to be written, that Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">sawest that that which Thou madest was good: and this is the eighth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Thou sawest every thing that Thou hadst made, and, behold, it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not only good, but also very good, as being now altogether. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">severally, they were only good; but altogether, both good, and very</p>
<p class="calibre1">good. All beautiful bodies express the same; by reason that a body</p>
<p class="calibre1">consisting of members all beautiful, is far more beautiful than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same members by themselves are, by whose well-ordered blending the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole is perfected; notwithstanding that the members severally be also</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I looked narrowly to find, whether seven, or eight times Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">sawest that Thy works were good, when they pleased Thee; but in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing I found no times, whereby I might understand that Thou sawest</p>
<p class="calibre1">so often, what Thou madest. And I said, “Lord, is not this Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scripture true, since Thou art true, and being Truth, hast set it</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth? why then dost Thou say unto me, ‘that in Thy seeing there be no</p>
<p class="calibre1">times’; whereas this Thy Scripture tells me, that what Thou madest</p>
<p class="calibre1">each day, Thou sawest that it was good: and when I counted them, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">found how often.” Unto this Thou answerest me, for Thou art my God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and with a strong voice tellest Thy servant in his inner ear, breaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">through my deafness and crying, “O man, that which My Scripture saith,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I say: and yet doth that speak in time; but time has no relation to My</p>
<p class="calibre1">Word; because My Word exists in equal eternity with Myself. So the</p>
<p class="calibre1">things which ye see through My Spirit, I see; like as what ye speak by</p>
<p class="calibre1">My Spirit, I speak. And so when ye see those things in time, I see</p>
<p class="calibre1">them not in time; as when ye speak in time, I speak them not in time.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I heard, O Lord my God, and drank up a drop of sweetness out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thy truth, and understood, that certain men there be who mislike</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy works; and say, that many of them Thou madest, compelled by</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessity; such as the fabric of the heavens, and harmony of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stars; and that Thou madest them not of what was Thine, but that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they were otherwhere and from other sources created, for Thee to bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">together and compact and combine, when out of Thy conquered enemies</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou raisedst up the walls of the universe; that they, bound down by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the structure, might not again be able to rebel against Thee. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">other things, they say Thou neither madest them, nor even</p>
<p class="calibre1">compactedst them, such as all flesh and all very minute creatures, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever hath its root in the earth; but that a mind at enmity</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Thee, and another nature not created by Thee, and contrary unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, did, in these lower stages of the world, beget and frame these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things. Frenzied are they who say thus, because they see not Thy works</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Thy Spirit, nor recognise Thee in them.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they who by Thy Spirit see these things, Thou seest in them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore when they see that these things are good, Thou seest that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they are good; and whatsoever things for Thy sake please, Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasest in them, and what through Thy Spirit please us, they please</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee in us. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirit of a man, which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no</p>
<p class="calibre1">one, but the Spirit of God. Now we (saith he) have received, not the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might</p>
<p class="calibre1">know the things that are freely given to us of God. And I am</p>
<p class="calibre1">admonished, “Truly the things of God knoweth no one, but the Spirit of</p>
<p class="calibre1">God: how then do we also know, what things are given us of God?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Answer is made me; “because the things which we know by His Spirit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">even these no one knoweth, but the Spirit of God. For as it is rightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">said unto those that were to speak by the Spirit of God, it is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye that speak: so is it rightly said to them that know through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit of God, ‘It is not ye that know.’ And no less then is it</p>
<p class="calibre1">rightly said to those that see through the Spirit of God, ‘It is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye that see’; so whatsoever through the Spirit of God they see to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">good, it is not they, but God that sees that it is good.” It is one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing then for a man to think that to be ill which is good, as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forenamed do; another, that that which is good, a man should see</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it is good (as Thy creatures be pleasing unto many, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">they be good, whom yet Thou pleasest not in them, when they prefer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to enjoy them, to Thee); and another, that when a man sees a thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it is good, God should in him see that it is good, so, namely,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that He should be loved in that which He made, Who cannot be loved,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but by the Holy Ghost which He hath given. Because the love of God</p>
<p class="calibre1">is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Which is given unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">us: by Whom we see that whatsoever in any degree is, is good. For from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him it is, who Himself Is not in degree, but what He Is, Is.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to Thee, O Lord. We behold the heaven and earth, whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">the corporeal part, superior and inferior, or the spiritual and</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporeal creature; and in the adorning of these parts, whereof the</p>
<p class="calibre1">universal pile of the world, or rather the universal creation, doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">consist, we see light made, and divided from the darkness. We see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the firmament of heaven, whether that primary body of the world,</p>
<p class="calibre1">between the spiritual upper waters and the inferior corporeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters, or (since this also is called heaven) this space of air</p>
<p class="calibre1">through which wander the fowls of heaven, betwixt those waters which</p>
<p class="calibre1">are in vapours borne above them, and in clear nights distill down in</p>
<p class="calibre1">dew; and those heavier waters which flow along the earth. We behold</p>
<p class="calibre1">a face of waters gathered together in the fields of the sea; and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dry land both void, and formed so as to be visible and harmonized, yea</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the matter of herbs and trees. We behold the lights shining from</p>
<p class="calibre1">above, the sun to suffice for the day, the moon and the stars to cheer</p>
<p class="calibre1">the night; and that by all these, times should be marked and</p>
<p class="calibre1">signified. We behold on all sides a moist element, replenished with</p>
<p class="calibre1">fishes, beasts, and birds; because the grossness of the air, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">bears up the flights of birds, thickeneth itself by the exhalation</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the waters. We behold the face of the earth decked out with earthly</p>
<p class="calibre1">creatures, and man, created after Thy image and likeness, even through</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Thy very image and likeness (that is the power of reason and</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding), set over all irrational creatures. And as in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul there is one power which has dominion by directing, another</p>
<p class="calibre1">made subject, that it might obey; so was there for the man,</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporeally also, made a woman, who in the mind of her reasonable</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding should have a parity of nature, but in the sex of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">body, should be in like manner subject to the sex of her husband, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the appetite of doing is fain to conceive the skill of right-doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the reason of the mind. These things we behold, and they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">severally good, and altogether very good.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let Thy works praise Thee, that we may love Thee; and let us love</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, that Thy works may praise Thee, which from time have beginning</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ending, rising and setting, growth and decay, form and</p>
<p class="calibre1">privation. They have then their succession of morning and evening,</p>
<p class="calibre1">part secretly, part apparently; for they were made of nothing, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, not of Thee; not of any matter not Thine, or that was before,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but of matter concreated (that is, at the same time created by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee), because to its state without form, Thou without any interval of</p>
<p class="calibre1">time didst give form. For seeing the matter of heaven and earth is one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, and the form another, Thou madest the matter of merely nothing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but the form of the world out of the matter without form: yet both</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, so that the form should follow the matter, without any</p>
<p class="calibre1">interval of delay.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have also examined what Thou willedst to be shadowed forth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether by the creation, or the relation of things in such an order.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And we have seen, that things singly are good, and together very good,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thy Word, in Thy Only-Begotten, both heaven and earth, the Head and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the body of the Church, in Thy predestination before all times,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without morning and evening. But when Thou begannest to execute in</p>
<p class="calibre1">time the things predestinated, to the end Thou mightest reveal</p>
<p class="calibre1">hidden things, and rectify our disorders; for our sins hung over us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and we had sunk into the dark deep; and Thy good Spirit was borne over</p>
<p class="calibre1">us, to help us in due season; and Thou didst justify the ungodly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and dividest them from the wicked; and Thou madest the firmament of</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority of Thy Book between those placed above, who were to he</p>
<p class="calibre1">docile unto Thee, and those under, who were to be subject to them: and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou gatheredst together the society of unbelievers into one</p>
<p class="calibre1">conspiracy, that the zeal of the faithful might appear, and they might</p>
<p class="calibre1">bring forth works of mercy, even distributing to the poor their</p>
<p class="calibre1">earthly riches, to obtain heavenly. And after this didst Thou kindle</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain lights in the firmament, Thy Holy ones, having the word of</p>
<p class="calibre1">life; and shining with an eminent authority set on high through</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual gifts; after that again, for the initiation of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unbelieving Gentiles, didst Thou out of corporeal matter produce the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sacraments, and visible miracles, and forms of words according to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the firmament of Thy Book, by which the faithful should be blessed and</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiplied. Next didst Thou form the living soul of the faithful,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through affections well ordered by the vigour of continency: and after</p>
<p class="calibre1">that, the mind subjected to Thee alone and needing to imitate no human</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority, hast Thou renewed after Thy image and likeness; and didst</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject its rational actions to the excellency of the understanding,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the woman to the man; and to all Offices of Thy Ministry, necessary</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the perfecting of the faithful in this life, Thou willedst, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">for their temporal uses, good things, fruitful to themselves in time</p>
<p class="calibre1">to come, be given by the same faithful. All these we see, and they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">very good, because Thou seest them in us, Who hast given unto us Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit, by which we might see them, and in them love Thee.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O Lord God, give peace unto us: (for Thou hast given us all things;)</p>
<p class="calibre1">the peace of rest, the peace of the Sabbath, which hath no evening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For all this most goodly array of things very good, having finished</p>
<p class="calibre1">their courses, is to pass away, for in them there was morning and</p>
<p class="calibre1">evening.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the seventh day hath no evening, nor hath it setting; because</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast sanctified it to an everlasting continuance; that that which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou didst after Thy works which were very good, resting the seventh</p>
<p class="calibre1">day, although Thou madest them in unbroken rest, that may the voice of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy Book announce beforehand unto us, that we also after our works</p>
<p class="calibre1">(therefore very good, because Thou hast given them us), shall rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thee also in the Sabbath of eternal life.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For then shalt Thou rest in us, as now Thou workest in us; and so</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall that be Thy rest through us, as these are Thy works through</p>
<p class="calibre1">us. But Thou, Lord, ever workest, and art ever at rest. Nor dost</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou see in time, nor art moved in time, nor restest in a time; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet Thou makest things seen in time, yea the times themselves, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest which results from time.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">We therefore see these things which Thou madest, because they are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">but they are, because Thou seest them. And we see without, that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are, and within, that they are good, but Thou sawest them there,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when made, where Thou sawest them, yet to be made. And we were at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">later time moved to do well, after our hearts had conceived of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit; but in the former time we were moved to do evil, forsaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee; but Thou, the One, the Good God, didst never cease doing good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And we also have some good works, of Thy gift, but not eternal;</p>
<p class="calibre1">after them we trust to rest in Thy great hallowing. But Thou, being</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Good which needeth no good, art ever at rest, because Thy rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">is Thou Thyself. And what man can teach man to understand this? or</p>
<p class="calibre1">what Angel, an Angel? or what Angel, a man? Let it be asked of Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sought in Thee, knocked for at Thee; so, so shall it be received, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall it be found, so shall it be opened. Amen.</p>
