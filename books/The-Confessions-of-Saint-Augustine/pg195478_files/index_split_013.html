<h2 id="calibre_toc_10" class="calibre7">BOOK IX</h2><p class="calibre1">O Lord, I am Thy servant; I am Thy servant, and the son of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">handmaid: Thou hast broken my bonds in sunder. I will offer to Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sacrifice of Let my heart and my tongue praise Thee; yea, let</p>
<p class="calibre1">all my bones say, O Lord, who is like unto Thee? Let them say, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer Thou me, and say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. Who am I,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and what am I? What evil have not been either my deeds, or if not my</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeds, my words, or if not my words, my will? But Thou, O Lord, are</p>
<p class="calibre1">good and merciful, and Thy right hand had respect unto the depth of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">death, and from the bottom of my heart emptied that abyss of</p>
<p class="calibre1">corruption. And this Thy whole gift was, to nill what I willed, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">will what Thou willedst. But where through all those years, and out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what low and deep recess was my free-will called forth in a moment,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby to submit my neck to Thy easy yoke, and my shoulders unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy light burden, O Christ Jesus, my Helper and my Redeemer? How sweet</p>
<p class="calibre1">did it at once become to me, to want the sweetnesses of those toys!</p>
<p class="calibre1">and what I feared to be parted from, was now a joy to part with. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou didst cast them forth from me, Thou true and highest sweetness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou castest them forth, and for them enteredst in Thyself, sweeter</p>
<p class="calibre1">than all pleasure, though not to flesh and blood; brighter than all</p>
<p class="calibre1">light, but more hidden than all depths, higher than all honour, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">not to the high in their own conceits. Now was my soul free from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">biting cares of canvassing and getting, and weltering in filth, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">scratching off the itch of lust. And my infant tongue spake freely</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thee, my brightness, and my riches, and my health, the Lord my God.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I resolved in Thy sight, not tumultuously to tear, but gently to</p>
<p class="calibre1">withdraw, the service of my tongue from the marts of lip-labour:</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the young, no students in Thy law, nor in Thy peace, but in lying</p>
<p class="calibre1">dotages and law-skirmishes, should no longer buy at my mouth arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">for their madness. And very seasonably, it now wanted but very few</p>
<p class="calibre1">days unto the Vacation of the Vintage, and I resolved to endure</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, then in a regular way to take my leave, and having been</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchased by Thee, no more to return for sale. Our purpose then was</p>
<p class="calibre1">known to Thee; but to men, other than our own friends, was it not</p>
<p class="calibre1">known. For we had agreed among ourselves not to let it out abroad to</p>
<p class="calibre1">any: although to us, now ascending from the valley of tears, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">singing that song of degrees, Thou hadst given sharp arrows, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroying coals against the subtle tongue, which as though advising</p>
<p class="calibre1">for us, would thwart, and would out of love devour us, as it doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">its meat.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hadst pierced our hearts with Thy charity, and we carried Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">words as it were fixed in our entrails: and the examples of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servants, whom for black Thou hadst made bright, and for dead,</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive, being piled together in the receptacle of our thoughts, kindled</p>
<p class="calibre1">and burned up that our heavy torpor, that we should not sink down to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the abyss; and they fired us so vehemently, that all the blasts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">subtle tongues from gainsayers might only inflame us the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">fiercely, not extinguish us. Nevertheless, because for Thy Name’s sake</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Thou hast hallowed throughout the earth, this our vow and</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose might also find some to commend it, it seemed like ostentation</p>
<p class="calibre1">not to wait for the vacation now so near, but to quit beforehand a</p>
<p class="calibre1">public profession, which was before the eyes of all; so that all</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking on this act of mine, and observing how near was the time of</p>
<p class="calibre1">vintage which I wished to anticipate, would talk much of me, as if I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had desired to appear some great one. And what end had it served me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that people should repute and dispute upon my purpose, and that our</p>
<p class="calibre1">good should be evil spoken of.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, it had at first troubled me that in this very summer my</p>
<p class="calibre1">lungs began to give way, amid too great literary labour, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathe deeply with difficulty, and by the pain in my chest to show</p>
<p class="calibre1">that they were injured, and to refuse any full or lengthened speaking;</p>
<p class="calibre1">this had troubled me, for it almost constrained me of necessity to lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">down that burden of teaching, or, if I could be cured and recover,</p>
<p class="calibre1">at least to intermit it. But when the full wish for leisure, that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might see how that Thou art the Lord, arose, and was fixed, in me;</p>
<p class="calibre1">my God, Thou knowest, I began even to rejoice that I had this</p>
<p class="calibre1">secondary, and that no feigned, excuse, which might something moderate</p>
<p class="calibre1">the offence taken by those who, for their sons’ sake, wished me</p>
<p class="calibre1">never to have the freedom of Thy sons. Full then of such joy, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">endured till that interval of time were run; it may have been some</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty days, yet they were endured manfully; endured, for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">covetousness which aforetime bore a part of this heavy business, had</p>
<p class="calibre1">left me, and I remained alone, and had been overwhelmed, had not</p>
<p class="calibre1">patience taken its place. Perchance, some of Thy servants, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">brethren, may say that I sinned in this, that with a heart fully set</p>
<p class="calibre1">on Thy service, I suffered myself to sit even one hour in the chair of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lies. Nor would I be contentious. But hast not Thou, O most merciful</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, pardoned and remitted this sin also, with my other most horrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">and deadly sins, in the holy water?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Verecundus was worn down with care about this our blessedness, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">that being held back by bonds, whereby he was most straitly bound,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he saw that he should be severed from us. For himself was not yet a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian, his wife one of the faithful; and yet hereby, more</p>
<p class="calibre1">rigidly than by any other chain, was he let and hindered from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">journey which we had now essayed. For he would not, he said, be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian on any other terms than on those he could not. However, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">offered us courteously to remain at his country-house so long as we</p>
<p class="calibre1">should stay there. Thou, O Lord, shalt reward him in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">resurrection of the just, seeing Thou hast already given him the lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the righteous. For although, in our absence, being now at Rome,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was seized with bodily sickness, and therein being made a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian, and one of the faithful, he departed this life; yet hadst</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou mercy not on him only, but on us also: lest remembering the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceeding kindness of our friend towards us, yet unable to number</p>
<p class="calibre1">him among Thy flock, we should be agonised with intolerable sorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks unto Thee, our God, we are Thine: Thy suggestions and</p>
<p class="calibre1">consolations tell us, Faithful in promises, Thou now requitest</p>
<p class="calibre1">Verecundus for his country-house of Cassiacum, where from the fever of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world we reposed in Thee, with the eternal freshness of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paradise: for that Thou hast forgiven him his sins upon earth, in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich mountain, that mountain which yieldeth milk, Thine own mountain.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then had at that time sorrow, but Nebridius joy. For although</p>
<p class="calibre1">he also, not being yet a Christian, had fallen into the pit of that</p>
<p class="calibre1">most pernicious error, believing the flesh of Thy Son to be a phantom:</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet emerging thence, he believed as we did; not as yet endued with any</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sacraments of Thy Church, but a most ardent searcher out of truth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whom, not long after our conversion and regeneration by Thy Baptism,</p>
<p class="calibre1">being also a faithful member of the Church Catholic, and serving</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee in perfect chastity and continence amongst his people in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Africa, his whole house having through him first been made</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian, didst Thou release from the flesh; and now he lives in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Abraham’s bosom. Whatever that be, which is signified by that bosom,</p>
<p class="calibre1">there lives my Nebridius, my sweet friend, and Thy child, O Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">adopted of a freed man: there he liveth. For what other place is there</p>
<p class="calibre1">for such a soul? There he liveth, whereof he asked much of me, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor inexperienced man. Now lays he not his ear to my mouth, but his</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual mouth unto Thy fountain, and drinketh as much as he can</p>
<p class="calibre1">receive, wisdom in proportion to his thirst, endlessly happy. Nor do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">think that he is so inebriated therewith, as to forget me; seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, Lord, Whom he drinketh, art mindful of us. So were we then,</p>
<p class="calibre1">comforting Verecundus, who sorrowed, as far as friendship permitted,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that our conversion was of such sort; and exhorting him to become</p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful, according to his measure, namely, of a married estate; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">awaiting Nebridius to follow us, which, being so near, he was all</p>
<p class="calibre1">but doing: and so, lo! those days rolled by at length; for long and</p>
<p class="calibre1">many they seemed, for the love I bare to the easeful liberty, that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might sing to Thee, from my inmost marrow, My heart hath said unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, I have sought Thy face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now was the day come wherein I was in deed to be freed of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rhetoric Professorship, whereof in thought I was already freed. And it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was done. Thou didst rescue my tongue, whence Thou hadst before</p>
<p class="calibre1">rescued my heart. And I blessed Thee, rejoicing; retiring with all</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine to the villa. What I there did in writing, which was now enlisted</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thy service, though still, in this breathing-time as it were,</p>
<p class="calibre1">panting from the school of pride, my books may witness, as well what I</p>
<p class="calibre1">debated with others, as what with myself alone, before Thee: what with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nebridius, who was absent, my Epistles bear witness. And when shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have time to rehearse all Thy great benefits towards us at that</p>
<p class="calibre1">time, especially when hasting on to yet greater mercies? For my</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembrance recalls me, and pleasant is it to me, O Lord, to confess</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thee, by what inward goads Thou tamedst me; and how Thou hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">evened me, lowering the mountains and hills of my high imaginations,</p>
<p class="calibre1">straightening my crookedness, and smoothing my rough ways; and how</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou also subduedst the brother of my heart, Alypius, unto the name of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy Only Begotten, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which he would</p>
<p class="calibre1">not at first vouchsafe to have inserted in our writings. For rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">would he have them savour of the lofty cedars of the Schools, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lord hath now broken down, than of the wholesome herbs of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church, the antidote against serpents.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, in what accents spake I unto Thee, my God, when I read the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psalms of David, those faithful songs, and sounds of devotion, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">allow of no swelling spirit, as yet a Catechumen, and a novice in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy real love, resting in that villa, with Alypius a Catechumen, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother cleaving to us, in female garb with masculine faith, with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tranquillity of age, motherly love, Christian piety! Oh, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">accents did I utter unto Thee in those Psalms, and how was I by them</p>
<p class="calibre1">kindled towards Thee, and on fire to rehearse them, if possible,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the whole world, against the pride of mankind! And yet they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are sung through the whole world, nor can any hide himself from Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">heat. With what vehement and bitter sorrow was I angered at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manichees! and again I pitied them, for they knew not those</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sacraments, those medicines, and were mad against the antidote which</p>
<p class="calibre1">might have recovered them of their madness. How I would they had</p>
<p class="calibre1">then been somewhere near me, and without my knowing that they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">there, could have beheld my countenance, and heard my words, when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">read the fourth Psalm in that time of my rest, and how that Psalm</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrought upon me: When I called, the God of my righteousness heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">me; in tribulation Thou enlargedst me. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear my prayer. Would that what I uttered on these words, they could</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear, without my knowing whether they heard, lest they should think</p>
<p class="calibre1">I spake it for their sakes! Because in truth neither should I speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same things, nor in the same way, if I perceived that they heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">and saw me; nor if I spake them would they so receive them, as when</p>
<p class="calibre1">I spake by and for myself before Thee, out of the natural feelings</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my soul.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I trembled for fear, and again kindled with hope, and with rejoicing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thy mercy, O Father; and all issued forth both by mine eyes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice, when Thy good Spirit turning unto us, said, O ye sons of men,</p>
<p class="calibre1">how long slow of heart? why do ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?</p>
<p class="calibre1">For I had loved vanity, and sought after leasing. And Thou, O Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadst already magnified Thy Holy One, raising Him from the dead, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">setting Him at Thy right hand, whence from on high He should send</p>
<p class="calibre1">His promise, the Comforter, the Spirit of truth. And He had already</p>
<p class="calibre1">sent Him, but I knew it not; He had sent Him, because He was now</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnified, rising again from the dead, and ascending into heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For till then, the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">glorified. And the prophet cries out, How long, slow of heart? why</p>
<p class="calibre1">do ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Know this, that the Lord</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath magnified His Holy One. He cries out, How long? He cries out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Know this: and I so long, not knowing, loved vanity, and sought</p>
<p class="calibre1">after leasing: and therefore I heard and trembled, because it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoken unto such as I remembered myself to have been. For in those</p>
<p class="calibre1">phantoms which I had held for truths, was there vanity and leasing;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I spake aloud many things earnestly and forcibly, in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bitterness of my remembrance. Which would they had heard, who yet love</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanity and seek after leasing! They would perchance have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubled, and have vomited it up; and Thou wouldest hear them when</p>
<p class="calibre1">they cried unto Thee; for by a true death in the flesh did He die</p>
<p class="calibre1">for us, who now intercedeth unto Thee for us.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I further read, Be angry, and sin not. And how was I moved, O my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, who had now learned to be angry at myself for things past, that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might not sin in time to come! Yea, to be justly angry; for that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not another nature of a people of darkness which sinned for me, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they say who are not angry at themselves, and treasure up wrath</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the day of wrath, and of the revelation of Thy just</p>
<p class="calibre1">judgment. Nor were my good things now without, nor sought with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes of flesh in that earthly sun; for they that would have joy from</p>
<p class="calibre1">without soon become vain, and waste themselves on the things seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">and temporal, and in their famished thoughts do lick their very</p>
<p class="calibre1">shadows. Oh that they were wearied out with their famine, and said,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Who will show us good things? And we would say, and they hear, The</p>
<p class="calibre1">light of Thy countenance is sealed upon us. For we are not that</p>
<p class="calibre1">light which enlighteneth every man, but we are enlightened by Thee;</p>
<p class="calibre1">that having been sometimes darkness, we may be light in Thee. Oh</p>
<p class="calibre1">that they could see the eternal Internal, which having tasted, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">grieved that I could not show It them, so long as they brought me</p>
<p class="calibre1">their heart in their eyes roving abroad from Thee, while they said,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Who will show us good things? For there, where I was angry within</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself in my chamber, where I was inwardly pricked, where I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrificed, slaying my old man and commencing the purpose of a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">life, putting my trust in Thee,- there hadst Thou begun to grow</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweet unto me, and hadst put gladness in my heart. And I cried out, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">I read this outwardly, finding it inwardly. Nor would I be</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiplied with worldly goods; wasting away time, and wasted by</p>
<p class="calibre1">time; whereas I had in Thy eternal Simple Essence other corn, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wine, and oil.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with a loud cry of my heart I cried out in the next verse, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">in peace, O for The Self-same! O what said he, I will lay me down</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sleep, for who shall hinder us, when cometh to pass that saying</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory? And Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">surpassingly art the Self-same, Who art not changed; and in Thee is</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest which forgetteth all toil, for there is none other with Thee, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">are we to seek those many other things, which are not what Thou art:</p>
<p class="calibre1">but Thou, Lord, alone hast made me dwell in hope. I read, and kindled;</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor found I what to do to those deaf and dead, of whom myself had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been, a pestilent person, a bitter and a blind bawler against those</p>
<p class="calibre1">writings, which are honied with the honey of heaven, and lightsome</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Thine own light: and I was consumed with zeal at the enemies of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this Scripture.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">When shall I recall all which passed in those holy-days? Yet neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">have I forgotten, nor will I pass over the severity of Thy scourge,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the wonderful swiftness of Thy mercy. Thou didst then torment me</p>
<p class="calibre1">with pain in my teeth; which when it had come to such height that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could not speak, it came into my heart to desire all my friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">present to pray for me to Thee, the God of all manner of health. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">this I wrote on wax, and gave it them to read. Presently so soon as</p>
<p class="calibre1">with humble devotion we had bowed our knees, that pain went away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what pain? or how went it away? I was affrighted, O my Lord, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God; for from infancy I had never experienced the like. And the</p>
<p class="calibre1">power of Thy Nod was deeply conveyed to me, and rejoicing in faith,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I praised Thy Name. And that faith suffered me not to be at ease about</p>
<p class="calibre1">my past sins, which were not yet forgiven me by Thy baptism.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vintage-vacation ended, I gave notice to the Milanese to provide</p>
<p class="calibre1">their scholars with another master to sell words to them; for that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had both made choice to serve Thee, and through my difficulty of</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing and pain in my chest was not equal to the Professorship. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">by letters I signified to Thy Prelate, the holy man Ambrose, my former</p>
<p class="calibre1">errors and present desires, begging his advice what of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scriptures I had best read, to become readier and fitter for receiving</p>
<p class="calibre1">so great grace. He recommended Isaiah the Prophet: I believe,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because he above the rest is a more clear foreshower of the Gospel and</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the calling of the Gentiles. But I, not understanding the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">lesson in him, and imagining the whole to be like it, laid it by, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be resumed when better practised in our Lord’s own words.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thence, when the time was come wherein I was to give in my name,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we left the country and returned to Milan. It pleased Alypius also</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be with me born again in Thee, being already clothed with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">humility befitting Thy Sacraments; and a most valiant tamer of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">body, so as, with unwonted venture, to wear the frozen ground of Italy</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his bare feet. We joined with us the boy Adeodatus, born after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the flesh, of my sin. Excellently hadst Thou made him. He was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite fifteen, and in wit surpassed many grave and learned men. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess unto Thee Thy gifts, O Lord my God, Creator of all, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">abundantly able to reform our deformities: for I had no part in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy, but the sin. For that we brought him up in Thy discipline, it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, none else, had inspired us with it. I confess unto Thee Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">gifts. There is a book of ours entitled The Master; it is a dialogue</p>
<p class="calibre1">between him and me. Thou knowest that all there ascribed to the person</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversing with me were his ideas, in his sixteenth year. Much</p>
<p class="calibre1">besides, and yet more admirable, I found in him. That talent struck</p>
<p class="calibre1">awe into me. And who but Thou could be the workmaster of such wonders?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon didst Thou take his life from the earth: and I now remember him</p>
<p class="calibre1">without anxiety, fearing nothing for his childhood or youth, or his</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole self. Him we joined with us, our contemporary in grace, to he</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought up in Thy discipline: and we were baptised, and anxiety for</p>
<p class="calibre1">our past life vanished from us. Nor was I sated in those days with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondrous sweetness of considering the depth of Thy counsels concerning</p>
<p class="calibre1">the salvation of mankind. How did I weep, in Thy Hymns and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Canticles, touched to the quick by the voices of Thy sweet-attuned</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church! The voices flowed into mine ears, and the Truth distilled into</p>
<p class="calibre1">my heart, whence the affections of my devotion overflowed, and tears</p>
<p class="calibre1">ran down, and happy was I therein.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not long had the Church of Milan begun to use this kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">consolation and exhortation, the brethren zealously joining with</p>
<p class="calibre1">harmony of voice and hearts. For it was a year, or not much more, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Justina, mother to the Emperor Valentinian, a child, persecuted Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servant Ambrose, in favour of her heresy, to which she was seduced</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the Arians. The devout people kept watch in the Church, ready to</p>
<p class="calibre1">die with their Bishop Thy servant. There my mother Thy handmaid,</p>
<p class="calibre1">bearing a chief part of those anxieties and watchings, lived for</p>
<p class="calibre1">prayer. We, yet unwarmed by the heat of Thy Spirit, still were stirred</p>
<p class="calibre1">up by the sight of the amazed and disquieted city. Then it was first</p>
<p class="calibre1">instituted that after the manner of the Eastern Churches, Hymns and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psalms should be sung, lest the people should wax faint through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tediousness of sorrow: and from that day to this the custom is</p>
<p class="calibre1">retained, divers (yea, almost all) Thy congregations, throughout other</p>
<p class="calibre1">parts of the world following herein.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then didst Thou by a vision discover to Thy forenamed Bishop where</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bodies of Gervasius and Protasius the martyrs lay hid (whom Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadst in Thy secret treasury stored uncorrupted so many years), whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou mightest seasonably produce them to repress the fury of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman, but an Empress. For when they were discovered and dug up, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">with due honour translated to the Ambrosian Basilica, not only they</p>
<p class="calibre1">who were vexed with unclean spirits (the devils confessing themselves)</p>
<p class="calibre1">were cured, but a certain man who had for many years been blind, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizen, and well known to the city, asking and hearing the reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the people’s confused joy, sprang forth desiring his guide to</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead him thither. Led thither, he begged to be allowed to touch with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his handkerchief the bier of Thy saints, whose death is precious in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy sight. Which when he had done, and put to his eyes, they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">forthwith opened. Thence did the fame spread, thence Thy praises</p>
<p class="calibre1">glowed, shone; thence the mind of that enemy, though not turned to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">soundness of believing, was yet turned back from her fury of</p>
<p class="calibre1">persecuting. Thanks to Thee, O my God. Whence and whither hast Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">thus led my remembrance, that I should confess these things also</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thee? which great though they be, I had passed by in</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgetfulness. And yet then, when the odour of Thy ointments was so</p>
<p class="calibre1">fragrant, did we not run after Thee. Therefore did I more weep among</p>
<p class="calibre1">the singing of Thy Hymns, formerly sighing after Thee, and at length</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing in Thee, as far as the breath may enter into this our</p>
<p class="calibre1">house of grass.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou that makest men to dwell of one mind in one house, didst join</p>
<p class="calibre1">with us Euodius also, a young man of our own city. Who being an</p>
<p class="calibre1">officer of Court, was before us converted to Thee and baptised: and</p>
<p class="calibre1">quitting his secular warfare, girded himself to Thine. We were</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, about to dwell together in our devout purpose. We sought</p>
<p class="calibre1">where we might serve Thee most usefully, and were together returning</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Africa: whitherward being as far as Ostia, my mother departed</p>
<p class="calibre1">this life. Much I omit, as hastening much. Receive my confessions</p>
<p class="calibre1">and thanksgivings, O my God, for innumerable things whereof I am</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent. But I will not omit whatsoever my soul would bring forth</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerning that Thy handmaid, who brought me forth, both in the flesh,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I might be born to this temporal light, and in heart, that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be born to Light eternal. Not her gifts, but Thine in her, would</p>
<p class="calibre1">I speak of; for neither did she make nor educate herself. Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">createdst her; nor did her father and mother know what a one should</p>
<p class="calibre1">come from them. And the sceptre of Thy Christ, the discipline of Thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">only Son, in a Christian house, a good member of Thy Church,</p>
<p class="calibre1">educated her in Thy fear. Yet for her good discipline was she wont</p>
<p class="calibre1">to commend not so much her mother’s diligence, as that of a certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">decrepit maid-servant, who had carried her father when a child, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">little ones used to be carried at the backs of elder girls. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">which reason, and for her great age, and excellent conversation, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">she, in that Christian family, well respected by its heads. Whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">also the charge of her master’s daughters was entrusted to her, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">which she gave diligent heed, restraining them earnestly, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary, with a holy severity, and teaching them with a grave</p>
<p class="calibre1">discretion. For, except at those hours wherein they were most</p>
<p class="calibre1">temporately fed at their parents’ table, she would not suffer them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">though parched with thirst, to drink even water; preventing an evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">custom, and adding this wholesome advice: “Ye drink water now, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">you have not wine in your power; but when you come to be married,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and be made mistresses of cellars and cupboards, you will scorn water,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but the custom of drinking will abide.” By this method of instruction,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the authority she had, she refrained the greediness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">childhood, and moulded their very thirst to such an excellent</p>
<p class="calibre1">moderation that what they should not, that they would not.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet (as Thy handmaid told me her son) there had crept upon her a</p>
<p class="calibre1">love of wine. For when (as the manner was) she, as though a sober</p>
<p class="calibre1">maiden, was bidden by her parents to draw wine out of the hogshed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding the vessel under the opening, before she poured the wine</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the flagon, she sipped a little with the tip of her lips; for</p>
<p class="calibre1">more her instinctive feelings refused. For this she did, not out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any desire of drink, but out of the exuberance of youth, whereby it</p>
<p class="calibre1">boils over in mirthful freaks, which in youthful spirits are wont to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be kept under by the gravity of their elders. And thus by adding to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that little, daily littles (for whoso despiseth little things shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall by little and little), she had fallen into such a habit as</p>
<p class="calibre1">greedily to drink off her little cup brim-full almost of wine. Where</p>
<p class="calibre1">was then that discreet old woman, and that her earnest countermanding?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Would aught avail against a secret disease, if Thy healing hand, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, watched not over us? Father, mother, and governors absent,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou present, who createdst, who callest, who also by those set over</p>
<p class="calibre1">us, workest something towards the salvation of our souls, what didst</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou then, O my God? how didst Thou cure her? how heal her? didst Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">not out of another soul bring forth a hard and a sharp taunt, like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lancet out of Thy secret store, and with one touch remove all that</p>
<p class="calibre1">foul stuff? For a maid-servant with whom she used to go to the cellar,</p>
<p class="calibre1">falling to words (as it happens) with her little mistress, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone with her, taunted her with this fault, with most bitter</p>
<p class="calibre1">insult, calling her wine-bibber. With which taunt she, stung to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">quick, saw the foulness of her fault, and instantly condemned and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forsook it. As flattering friends pervert, so reproachful enemies</p>
<p class="calibre1">mostly correct. Yet not what by them Thou doest, but what themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">purposed, dost Thou repay them. For she in her anger sought to vex her</p>
<p class="calibre1">young mistress, not to amend her; and did it in private, either for</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the time and place of the quarrel so found them; or lest</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself also should have anger, for discovering it thus late. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, Lord, Governor of all in heaven and earth, who turnest to Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">purposes the deepest currents, and the ruled turbulence of the tide of</p>
<p class="calibre1">times, didst by the very unhealthiness of one soul heal another;</p>
<p class="calibre1">lest any, when he observes this, should ascribe it to his own power,</p>
<p class="calibre1">even when another, whom he wished to be reformed, is reformed</p>
<p class="calibre1">through words of his.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brought up thus modestly and soberly, and made subject rather by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee to her parents, than by her parents to Thee, so soon as she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">of marriageable age, being bestowed upon a husband, she served him</p>
<p class="calibre1">as her lord; and did her diligence to win him unto Thee, preaching</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee unto him by her conversation; by which Thou ornamentedst her,</p>
<p class="calibre1">making her reverently amiable, and admirable unto her husband. And she</p>
<p class="calibre1">so endured the wronging of her bed as never to have any quarrel with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her husband thereon. For she looked for Thy mercy upon him, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">believing in Thee, he might be made chaste. But besides this, he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">fervid, as in his affections, so in anger: but she had learnt not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">resist an angry husband, not in deed only, but not even in word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only when he was smoothed and tranquil, and in a temper to receive it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she would give an account of her actions, if haply he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhastily taken offence. In a word, while many matrons, who had</p>
<p class="calibre1">milder husbands, yet bore even in their faces marks of shame, would in</p>
<p class="calibre1">familiar talk blame their husbands’ lives, she would blame their</p>
<p class="calibre1">tongues, giving them, as in jest, earnest advice: “That from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time they heard the marriage writings read to them, they should</p>
<p class="calibre1">account them as indentures, whereby they were made servants; and so,</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembering their condition, ought not to set themselves up against</p>
<p class="calibre1">their lords.” And when they, knowing what a choleric husband she</p>
<p class="calibre1">endured, marvelled that it had never been heard, nor by any token</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceived, that Patricius had beaten his wife, or that there had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been any domestic difference between them, even for one day, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidentially asking the reason, she taught them her practice above</p>
<p class="calibre1">mentioned. Those wives who observed it found the good, and returned</p>
<p class="calibre1">thanks; those who observed it not, found no relief, and suffered.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her mother-in-law also, at first by whisperings of evil servants</p>
<p class="calibre1">incensed against her, she so overcame by observance and persevering</p>
<p class="calibre1">endurance and meekness, that she of her own accord discovered to her</p>
<p class="calibre1">son the meddling tongues whereby the domestic peace betwixt her and</p>
<p class="calibre1">her daughter-in-law had been disturbed, asking him to correct them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, when in compliance with his mother, and for the well-ordering of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the family, he had with stripes corrected those discovered, at her</p>
<p class="calibre1">will who had discovered them, she promised the like reward to any who,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to please her, should speak ill of her daughter-in-law to her: and</p>
<p class="calibre1">none now venturing, they lived together with a remarkable sweetness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mutual kindness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This great gift also thou bestowedst, O my God, my mercy, upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">that good handmaid of Thine, in whose womb Thou createdst me, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">between any disagreeing and discordant parties where she was able, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed herself such a peacemaker, that hearing on both sides most</p>
<p class="calibre1">bitter things, such as swelling and indigested choler uses to break</p>
<p class="calibre1">out into, when the crudities of enmities are breathed out in sour</p>
<p class="calibre1">discourses to a present friend against an absent enemy, she never</p>
<p class="calibre1">would disclose aught of the one unto the other, but what might tend to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their reconcilement. A small good this might appear to me, did I not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to my grief know numberless persons, who through some horrible and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide-spreading contagion of sin, not only disclose to persons mutually</p>
<p class="calibre1">angered things said in anger, but add withal things never spoken,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereas to humane humanity, it ought to seem a light thing not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">toment or increase ill will by ill words, unless one study withal by</p>
<p class="calibre1">good words to quench it. Such was she, Thyself, her most inward</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instructor, teaching her in the school of the heart.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, her own husband, towards the very end of his earthly</p>
<p class="calibre1">life, did she gain unto Thee; nor had she to complain of that in him</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a believer, which before he was a believer she had borne from</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. She was also the servant of Thy servants; whosoever of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew her, did in her much praise and honour and love Thee; for that</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the witness of the fruits of a holy conversation they</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceived Thy presence in her heart. For she had been the wife of</p>
<p class="calibre1">one man, had requited her parents, had govemed her house piously,</p>
<p class="calibre1">was well reported of for good works, had brought up children, so often</p>
<p class="calibre1">travailing in birth of them, as she saw them swerving from Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lastly, of all of us Thy servants, O Lord (whom on occasion of Thy own</p>
<p class="calibre1">gift Thou sufferest to speak), us, who before her sleeping in Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">lived united together, having received the grace of Thy baptism, did</p>
<p class="calibre1">she so take care of, as though she had been mother of us all; so</p>
<p class="calibre1">served us, as though she had been child to us all.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The day now approaching whereon she was to depart this life (which</p>
<p class="calibre1">day Thou well knewest, we knew not), it came to pass, Thyself, as I</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe, by Thy secret ways so ordering it, that she and I stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone, leaning in a certain window, which looked into the garden of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the house where we now lay, at Ostia; where removed from the din of</p>
<p class="calibre1">men, we were recruiting from the fatigues of a long journey, for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voyage. We were discoursing then together, alone, very sweetly; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">those things which are before, we were enquiring between ourselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the presence of the Truth, which Thou art, of what sort the eternal</p>
<p class="calibre1">life of the saints was to be, which eye hath not seen, nor ear</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man. But yet we gasped</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the mouth of our heart, after those heavenly streams of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">fountain, the fountain of life, which is with Thee; that being bedewed</p>
<p class="calibre1">thence according to our capacity, we might in some sort meditate</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon so high a mystery.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And when our discourse was brought to that point, that the very</p>
<p class="calibre1">highest delight of the earthly senses, in the very purest material</p>
<p class="calibre1">light, was, in respect of the sweetness of that life, not only not</p>
<p class="calibre1">worthy of comparison, but not even of mention; we raising up ourselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a more glowing affection towards the “Self-same,” did by</p>
<p class="calibre1">degrees pass through all things bodily, even the very heaven whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun and moon and stars shine upon the earth; yea, we were soaring</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher yet, by inward musing, and discourse, and admiring of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">works; and we came to our own minds, and went beyond them, that we</p>
<p class="calibre1">might arrive at that region of never-failing plenty, where Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">feedest Israel for ever with the food of truth, and where life is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Wisdom by whom all these things are made, and what have been,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and what shall be, and she is not made, but is, as she hath been,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and so shall she be ever; yea rather, to “have been,” and “hereafter</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be,” are not in her, but only “to be,” seeing she is eternal. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">to “have been,” and to “be hereafter,” are not eternal. And while we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were discoursing and panting after her, we slightly touched on her</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the whole effort of our heart; and we sighed, and there we</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave bound the first fruits of the Spirit; and returned to vocal</p>
<p class="calibre1">expressions of our mouth, where the word spoken has beginning and end.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And what is like unto Thy Word, our Lord, who endureth in Himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">without becoming old, and maketh all things new?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were saying then: If to any the tumult of the flesh were</p>
<p class="calibre1">hushed, hushed the images of earth, and waters, and air, hushed also</p>
<p class="calibre1">the pole of heaven, yea the very soul be hushed to herself, and by not</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking on self surmount self, hushed all dreams and imaginary</p>
<p class="calibre1">revelations, every tongue and every sign, and whatsoever exists only</p>
<p class="calibre1">in transition, since if any could hear, all these say, We made not</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves, but He made us that abideth for ever-If then having</p>
<p class="calibre1">uttered this, they too should be hushed, having roused only our ears</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Him who made them, and He alone speak, not by them but by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Himself, that we may hear His Word, not through any tongue of flesh,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor Angel’s voice, nor sound of thunder, nor in the dark riddle of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">similitude, but might hear Whom in these things we love, might hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">His Very Self without these (as we two now strained ourselves, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in swift thought touched on that Eternal Wisdom which abideth over</p>
<p class="calibre1">all); -could this be continued on, and other visions of kind far</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlike be withdrawn, and this one ravish, and absorb, and wrap up</p>
<p class="calibre1">its beholder amid these inward joys, so that life might be for ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">like that one moment of understanding which now we sighed after;</p>
<p class="calibre1">were not this, Enter into thy Master’s joy? And when shall that be?</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we shall all rise again, though we shall not all be changed?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such things was I speaking, and even if not in this very manner, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">these same words, yet, Lord, Thou knowest that in that day when we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were speaking of these things, and this world with all its delights</p>
<p class="calibre1">became, as we spake, contemptible to us, my mother said, “Son, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine own part I have no further delight in any thing in this life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What I do here any longer, and to what I am here, I know not, now that</p>
<p class="calibre1">my hopes in this world are accomplished. One thing there was for which</p>
<p class="calibre1">I desired to linger for a while in this life, that I might see thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">a Catholic Christian before I died. My God hath done this for me</p>
<p class="calibre1">more abundantly, that I should now see thee withal, despising</p>
<p class="calibre1">earthly happiness, become His servant: what do I here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What answer I made her unto these things, I remember not. For scarce</p>
<p class="calibre1">five days after, or not much more, she fell sick of a fever; and in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that sickness one day she fell into a swoon, and was for a while</p>
<p class="calibre1">withdrawn from these visible things. We hastened round her; but she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was soon brought back to her senses; and looking on me and my</p>
<p class="calibre1">brother standing by her, said to us enquiringly, “Where was I?” And</p>
<p class="calibre1">then looking fixedly on us, with grief amazed: “Here,” saith she,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“shall you bury your mother.” I held my peace and refrained weeping;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but my brother spake something, wishing for her, as the happier lot,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that she might die, not in a strange place, but in her own land.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereat, she with anxious look, checking him with her eyes, for that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he still savoured such things, and then looking upon me: “Behold,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">saith she, “what he saith”: and soon after to us both, “Lay,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">saith, “this body any where; let not the care for that any way</p>
<p class="calibre1">disquiet you: this only I request, that you would remember me at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord’s altar, wherever you be.” And having delivered this sentiment in</p>
<p class="calibre1">what words she could, she held her peace, being exercised by her</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing sickness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I, considering Thy gifts, Thou unseen God, which Thou instillest</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the hearts of Thy faithful ones, whence wondrous fruits do</p>
<p class="calibre1">spring, did rejoice and give thanks to Thee, recalling what I before</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew, how careful and anxious she had ever been as to her place of</p>
<p class="calibre1">burial, which she had provided and prepared for herself by the body of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her husband. For because they had lived in great harmony together, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">also wished (so little can the human mind embrace things divine) to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have this addition to that happiness, and to have it remembered</p>
<p class="calibre1">among men, that after her pilgrimage beyond the seas, what was earthly</p>
<p class="calibre1">of this united pair had been permitted to be united beneath the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth. But when this emptiness had through the fulness of Thy goodness</p>
<p class="calibre1">begun to cease in her heart, I knew not, and rejoiced admiring what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she had so disclosed to me; though indeed in that our discourse also</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the window, when she said, “What do I here any longer?” there</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared no desire of dying in her own country. I heard afterwards</p>
<p class="calibre1">also, that when we were now at Ostia, she with a mother’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidence, when I was absent, one day discoursed with certain of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends about the contempt of this life, and the blessing of death:</p>
<p class="calibre1">and when they were amazed at such courage which Thou hadst given to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a woman, and asked, “Whether she were not afraid to leave her body</p>
<p class="calibre1">so far from her own city?” she replied, “Nothing is far to God; nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">was it to be feared lest at the end of the world, He should not</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognise whence He were to raise me up.” On the ninth day then of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">sickness, and the fifty-sixth year of her age, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">three-and-thirtieth of mine, was that religious and holy soul freed</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the body.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I closed her eyes; and there flowed withal a mighty sorrow into my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, which was overflowing into tears; mine eyes at the same time,</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the violent command of my mind, drank up their fountain wholly dry;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and woe was me in such a strife! But when she breathed her last, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy Adeodatus burst out into a loud lament; then, checked by us all,</p>
<p class="calibre1">held his peace. In like manner also a childish feeling in me, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was, through my heart’s youthful voice, finding its vent in weeping,</p>
<p class="calibre1">was checked and silenced. For we thought it not fitting to solemnise</p>
<p class="calibre1">that funeral with tearful lament, and groanings; for thereby do they</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the most part express grief for the departed, as though unhappy,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or altogether dead; whereas she was neither unhappy in her death,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor altogether dead. Of this we were assured on good grounds, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">testimony of her good conversation and her faith unfeigned.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then was it which did grievously pain me within, but a fresh</p>
<p class="calibre1">wound wrought through the sudden wrench of that most sweet and dear</p>
<p class="calibre1">custom of living together? I joyed indeed in her testimony, when, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that her last sickness, mingling her endearments with my acts of duty,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she called me “dutiful,” and mentioned, with great affection of</p>
<p class="calibre1">love, that she never had heard any harsh or reproachful sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">uttered by my mouth against her. But yet, O my God, Who madest us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">what comparison is there betwixt that honour that I paid to her, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">her slavery for me? Being then forsaken of so great comfort in her, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul was wounded, and that life rent asunder as it were, which, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">hers and mine together, had been made but one.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The boy then being stilled from weeping, Euodius took up the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psalter, and began to sing, our whole house answering him, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psalm, I will sing of mercy and judgments to Thee, O Lord. But hearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">what we were doing, many brethren and religious women came together;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and whilst they (whose office it was) made ready for the burial, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the manner is, I (in a part of the house, where I might properly),</p>
<p class="calibre1">together with those who thought not fit to leave me, discoursed upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">something fitting the time; and by this balm of truth assuaged that</p>
<p class="calibre1">torment, known to Thee, they unknowing and listening intently, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceiving me to be without all sense of sorrow. But in Thy ears,</p>
<p class="calibre1">where none of them heard, I blamed the weakness of my feelings, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">refrained my flood of grief, which gave way a little unto me; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">again came, as with a tide, yet not so as to burst out into tears, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">to change of countenance; still I knew what I was keeping down in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart. And being very much displeased that these human things had such</p>
<p class="calibre1">power over me, which in the due order and appointment of our natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">condition must needs come to pass, with a new grief I grieved for my</p>
<p class="calibre1">grief, and was thus worn by a double sorrow.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And behold, the corpse was carried to the burial; we went and</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned without tears. For neither in those prayers which we poured</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth unto Thee, when the Sacrifice of our ransom was offered for her,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when now the corpse was by the grave’s side, as the manner there is,</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous to its being laid therein, did I weep even during those</p>
<p class="calibre1">prayers; yet was I the whole day in secret heavily sad, and with</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubled mind prayed Thee, as I could, to heal my sorrow, yet Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst not; impressing, I believe, upon my memory by this one instance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">how strong is the bond of all habit, even upon a soul, which now feeds</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon no deceiving Word. It seemed also good to me to go and bathe,</p>
<p class="calibre1">having heard that the bath had its name (balneum) from the Greek</p>
<p class="calibre1">Balaneion for that it drives sadness from the mind. And this also I</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess unto Thy mercy, Father of the fatherless, that I bathed, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the same as before I bathed. For the bitterness of sorrow could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not exude out of my heart. Then I slept, and woke up again, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">found my grief not a little softened; and as I was alone in my bed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I remembered those true verses of Thy Ambrose. For Thou art the</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maker of all, the Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Ruler of the height,</p>
<p class="calibre4">Who, robing day in light, hast poured</p>
<p class="calibre4">Soft slumbers o’er the night,</p>
<p class="calibre4">That to our limbs the power</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of toil may be renew’d,</p>
<p class="calibre4">And hearts be rais’d that sink and cower,</p>
<p class="calibre4">And sorrows be subdu’d.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then by little and little I recovered my former thoughts of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">handmaid, her holy conversation towards Thee, her holy tenderness</p>
<p class="calibre1">and observance towards us, whereof I was suddenly deprived: and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was minded to weep in Thy sight, for her and for myself, in her behalf</p>
<p class="calibre1">and in my own. And I gave way to the tears which I before</p>
<p class="calibre1">restrained, to overflow as much as they desired; reposing my heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon them; and it found rest in them, for it was in Thy ears, not in</p>
<p class="calibre1">those of man, who would have scornfully interpreted my weeping. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, Lord, in writing I confess it unto Thee. Read it, who will, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">interpret it, how he will: and if he finds sin therein, that I wept my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother for a small portion of an hour (the mother who for the time was</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead to mine eyes, who had for many years wept for me that I might</p>
<p class="calibre1">live in Thine eyes), let him not deride me; but rather, if he be one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of large charity, let him weep himself for my sins unto Thee, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Father of all the brethren of Thy Christ.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now, with a heart cured of that wound, wherein it might seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">blameworthy for an earthly feeling, I pour out unto Thee, our God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in behalf of that Thy handmaid, a far different kind of tears, flowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">from a spirit shaken by the thoughts of the dangers of every soul that</p>
<p class="calibre1">dieth in Adam. And although she having been quickened in Christ,</p>
<p class="calibre1">even before her release from the flesh, had lived to the praise of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">name for her faith and conversation; yet dare I not say that from what</p>
<p class="calibre1">time Thou regeneratedst her by baptism, no word issued from her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth against Thy Commandment. Thy Son, the Truth, hath said,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whosoever shall say unto his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of</p>
<p class="calibre1">hell fire. And woe be even unto the commendable life of men, if,</p>
<p class="calibre1">laying aside mercy, Thou shouldest examine it. But because Thou art</p>
<p class="calibre1">not extreme in enquiring after sins, we confidently hope to find</p>
<p class="calibre1">some place with Thee. But whosoever reckons up his real merits to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, what reckons he up to Thee but Thine own gifts? O that men would</p>
<p class="calibre1">know themselves to be men; and that he that glorieth would glory in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lord.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I therefore, O my Praise and my Life, God of my heart, laying</p>
<p class="calibre1">aside for a while her good deeds, for which I give thanks to Thee with</p>
<p class="calibre1">joy, do now beseech Thee for the sins of my mother. Hearken unto me, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">entreat Thee, by the Medicine of our wounds, Who hung upon the tree,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and now sitting at Thy right hand maketh intercession to Thee for</p>
<p class="calibre1">us. I know that she dealt mercifully, and from her heart forgave her</p>
<p class="calibre1">debtors their debts; do Thou also forgive her debts, whatever she</p>
<p class="calibre1">may have contracted in so many years, since the water of salvation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Forgive her, Lord, forgive, I beseech Thee; enter not into judgment</p>
<p class="calibre1">with her. Let Thy mercy be exalted above Thy justice, since Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">words are true, and Thou hast promised mercy unto the merciful;</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Thou gavest them to be, who wilt have mercy on whom Thou wilt</p>
<p class="calibre1">have mercy; and wilt have compassion on whom Thou hast had compassion.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, I believe, Thou hast already done what I ask; but accept, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, the free-will offerings of my mouth. For she, the day of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">dissolution now at hand, took no thought to have her body</p>
<p class="calibre1">sumptuously wound up, or embalmed with spices; nor desired she a</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice monument, or to be buried in her own land. These things she</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoined us not; but desired only to have her name commemorated at Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Altar, which she had served without intermission of one day: whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">she knew the holy Sacrifice to be dispensed, by which the handwriting</p>
<p class="calibre1">that was against us is blotted out; through which the enemy was</p>
<p class="calibre1">triumphed over, who summing up our offences, and seeking what to lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">to our charge, found nothing in Him, in Whom we conquer. Who shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">restore to Him the innocent blood? Who repay Him the price wherewith</p>
<p class="calibre1">He bought us, and so take us from Him? Unto the Sacrament of which our</p>
<p class="calibre1">ransom, Thy handmaid bound her soul by the bond of faith. Let none</p>
<p class="calibre1">sever her from Thy protection: let neither the lion nor the dragon</p>
<p class="calibre1">interpose himself by force or fraud. For she will not answer that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she owes nothing, lest she be convicted and seized by the crafty</p>
<p class="calibre1">accuser: but she will answer that her sins are forgiven her by Him, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whom none can repay that price which He, Who owed nothing, paid for</p>
<p class="calibre1">us.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">May she rest then in peace with the husband before and after whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">she had never any; whom she obeyed, with patience bringing forth fruit</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thee, that she might win him also unto Thee. And inspire, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord my God, inspire Thy servants my brethren, Thy sons my masters,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom with voice, and heart, and pen I serve, that so many as shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">read these Confessions, may at Thy Altar remember Monnica Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">handmaid, with Patricius, her sometimes husband, by whose bodies</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou broughtest me into this life, how I know not. May they with</p>
<p class="calibre1">devout affection remember my parents in this transitory light, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">brethren under Thee our Father in our Catholic Mother, and my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fellow-citizens in that eternal Jerusalem which Thy pilgrim people</p>
<p class="calibre1">sigheth after from their Exodus, even unto their return thither.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That so my mother’s last request of me, may through my confessions,</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than through my prayers, be, through the prayers of many, more</p>
<p class="calibre1">abundantly fulfilled to her.</p>
