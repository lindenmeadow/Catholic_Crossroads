<h2 id="calibre_toc_6" class="calibre7">BOOK V</h2><p class="calibre1">Accept the sacrifice of my confessions from the ministry of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">tongue, which Thou hast formed and stirred up to confess unto Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">name. Heal Thou all my bones, and let them say, O Lord, who is like</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thee? For he who confesses to Thee doth not teach Thee what takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">place within him; seeing a closed heart closes not out Thy eye, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">can man’s hardheartedness thrust back Thy hand: for Thou dissolvest</p>
<p class="calibre1">it at Thy will in pity or in vengeance, and nothing can hide itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Thy heat. But let my soul praise Thee, that it may love Thee; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">let it confess Thy own mercies to Thee, that it may praise Thee. Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole creation ceaseth not, nor is silent in Thy praises; neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spirit of man with voice directed unto Thee, nor creation</p>
<p class="calibre1">animate or inanimate, by the voice of those who meditate thereon: that</p>
<p class="calibre1">so our souls may from their weariness arise towards Thee, leaning on</p>
<p class="calibre1">those things which Thou hast created, and passing on to Thyself, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">madest them wonderfully; and there is refreshment and true strength.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let the restless, the godless, depart and flee from Thee; yet Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">seest them, and dividest the darkness. And behold, the universe with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them is fair, though they are foul. And how have they injured Thee? or</p>
<p class="calibre1">how have they disgraced Thy government, which, from the heaven to this</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowest earth, is just and perfect? For whither fled they, when they</p>
<p class="calibre1">fled from Thy presence? or where dost not Thou find them? But they</p>
<p class="calibre1">fled, that they might not see Thee seeing them, and, blinded, might</p>
<p class="calibre1">stumble against Thee (because Thou forsakest nothing Thou hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">made); that the unjust, I say, might stumble upon Thee, and justly</p>
<p class="calibre1">be hurt; withdrawing themselves from thy gentleness, and stumbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">at Thy uprightness, and falling upon their own ruggedness. Ignorant,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in truth, that Thou art every where, Whom no place encompasseth! and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou alone art near, even to those that remove far from Thee. Let them</p>
<p class="calibre1">then be turned, and seek Thee; because not as they have forsaken their</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creator, hast Thou forsaken Thy creation. Let them be turned and</p>
<p class="calibre1">seek Thee; and behold, Thou art there in their heart, in the heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">of those that confess to Thee, and cast themselves upon Thee, and weep</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thy bosom, after all their rugged ways. Then dost Thou gently</p>
<p class="calibre1">wipe away their tears, and they weep the more, and joy in weeping;</p>
<p class="calibre1">even for that Thou, Lord, -not man of flesh and blood, but -Thou,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, who madest them, re-makest and comfortest them. But where was I,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when I was seeking Thee? And Thou wert before me, but I had gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">away from Thee; nor did I find myself, how much less Thee!</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I would lay open before my God that nine-and-twentieth year of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine age. There had then come to Carthage a certain Bishop of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manichees, Faustus by name, a great snare of the Devil, and many</p>
<p class="calibre1">were entangled by him through that lure of his smooth language:</p>
<p class="calibre1">which though I did commend, yet could I separate from the truth of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">things which I was earnest to learn: nor did I so much regard the</p>
<p class="calibre1">service of oratory as the science which this Faustus, so praised among</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, set before me to feed upon. Fame had before bespoken him most</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowing in all valuable learning, and exquisitely skilled in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">liberal sciences. And since I had read and well remembered much of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">philosophers, I compared some things of theirs with those long</p>
<p class="calibre1">fables of the Manichees, and found the former the more probable;</p>
<p class="calibre1">even although they could only prevail so far as to make judgment of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this lower world, the Lord of it they could by no means find out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For Thou art great, O Lord, and hast respect unto the humble, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the proud Thou beholdest afar off. Nor dost Thou draw near, but to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrite in heart, nor art found by the proud, no, not though by</p>
<p class="calibre1">curious skill they could number the stars and the sand, and measure</p>
<p class="calibre1">the starry heavens, and track the courses of the planets.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For with their understanding and wit, which Thou bestowedst on them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they search out these things; and much have they found out; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">foretold, many years before, eclipses of those luminaries, the sun and</p>
<p class="calibre1">moon, -what day and hour, and how many digits, -nor did their</p>
<p class="calibre1">calculation fail; and it came to pass as they foretold; and they wrote</p>
<p class="calibre1">down the rules they had found out, and these are read at this day, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of them do others foretell in what year and month of the year, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what day of the month, and what hour of the day, and what part of</p>
<p class="calibre1">its light, moon or sun is to be eclipsed, and so it shall be, as it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">foreshowed. At these things men, that know not this art, marvel and</p>
<p class="calibre1">are astonished, and they that know it, exult, and are puffed up; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">by an ungodly pride departing from Thee, and failing of Thy light,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they foresee a failure of the sun’s light, which shall be, so long</p>
<p class="calibre1">before, but see not their own, which is. For they search not</p>
<p class="calibre1">religiously whence they have the wit, wherewith they search out</p>
<p class="calibre1">this. And finding that Thou madest them, they give not themselves up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thee, to preserve what Thou madest, nor sacrifice to Thee what they</p>
<p class="calibre1">have made themselves; nor slay their own soaring imaginations, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">fowls of the air, nor their own diving curiosities (wherewith, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fishes of the seal they wander over the unknown paths of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">abyss), nor their own luxuriousness, as beasts of the field, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, Lord, a consuming fire, mayest burn up those dead cares of</p>
<p class="calibre1">theirs, and re-create themselves immortally.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they knew not the way, Thy Word, by Whom Thou madest these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things which they number, and themselves who number, and the sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby they perceive what they number, and the understanding, out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of which they number; or that of Thy wisdom there is no number. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Only Begotten is Himself made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sanctification, and was numbered among us, and paid tribute unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Caesar. They knew not this way whereby to descend to Him from</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves, and by Him ascend unto Him. They knew not this way, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">deemed themselves exalted amongst the stars and shining; and behold,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they fell upon the earth, and their foolish heart was darkened. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">discourse many things truly concerning the creature; but Truth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Artificer of the creature, they seek not piously, and therefore find</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him not; or if they find Him, knowing Him to be God, they glorify</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him not as God, neither are thankful, but become vain in their</p>
<p class="calibre1">imaginations, and profess themselves to be wise, attributing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves what is Thine; and thereby with most perverse blindness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">study to impute to Thee what is their own, forging lies of Thee who</p>
<p class="calibre1">art the Truth, and changing the glory of uncorruptible God into an</p>
<p class="calibre1">image made like corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and creeping things, changing Thy truth into a lie, and worshipping</p>
<p class="calibre1">and serving the creature more than the Creator.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet many truths concerning the creature retained I from these men,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and saw the reason thereof from calculations, the succession of times,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the visible testimonies of the stars; and compared them with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying of Manichaeus, which in his frenzy he had written most</p>
<p class="calibre1">largely on these subjects; but discovered not any account of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">solstices, or equinoxes, or the eclipses of the greater lights, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever of this sort I had learned in the books of secular</p>
<p class="calibre1">philosophy. But I was commanded to believe; and yet it corresponded</p>
<p class="calibre1">not with what had been established by calculations and my own sight,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but was quite contrary.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doth then, O Lord God of truth, whoso knoweth these things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore please Thee? Surely unhappy is he who knoweth all these, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">knoweth not Thee: but happy whoso knoweth Thee, though he know not</p>
<p class="calibre1">these. And whoso knoweth both Thee and them is not the happier for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, but for Thee only, if, knowing Thee, he glorifies Thee as God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and is thankful, and becomes not vain in his imaginations. For as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is better off who knows how to possess a tree, and return thanks to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee for the use thereof, although he know not how many cubits high it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is, or how wide it spreads, than he that can measure it, and count all</p>
<p class="calibre1">its boughs, and neither owns it, nor knows or loves its Creator: so</p>
<p class="calibre1">a believer, whose all this world of wealth is, and who having nothing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet possesseth all things, by cleaving unto Thee, whom all things</p>
<p class="calibre1">serve, though he know not even the circles of the Great Bear, yet is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it folly to doubt but he is in a better state than one who can measure</p>
<p class="calibre1">the heavens, and number the stars, and poise the elements, yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">neglecteth Thee who hast made all things in number, weight, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But yet who bade that Manichaeus write on these things also, skill</p>
<p class="calibre1">in which was no element of piety? For Thou hast said to man, Behold</p>
<p class="calibre1">piety and wisdom; of which he might be ignorant, though he had perfect</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge of these things; but these things, since, knowing not, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">most impudently dared to teach, he plainly could have no knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of piety. For it is vanity to make profession of these worldly</p>
<p class="calibre1">things even when known; but confession to Thee is piety. Wherefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">this wanderer to this end spake much of these things, that convicted</p>
<p class="calibre1">by those who had truly learned them, it might be manifest what</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding he had in the other abstruser things. For he would not</p>
<p class="calibre1">have himself meanly thought of, but went about to persuade men,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That the Holy Ghost, the Comforter and Enricher of Thy faithful ones,</p>
<p class="calibre1">was with plenary authority personally within him.” When then he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">found out to have taught falsely of the heaven and stars, and of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">motions of the sun and moon (although these things pertain not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the doctrine of religion), yet his sacrilegious presumption would</p>
<p class="calibre1">become evident enough, seeing he delivered things which not only he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew not, but which were falsified, with so mad a vanity of pride,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he sought to ascribe them to himself, as to a divine person.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For when I hear any Christian brother ignorant of these things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and mistaken on them, I can patiently behold such a man holding his</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion; nor do I see that any ignorance as to the position or</p>
<p class="calibre1">character of the corporeal creation can injure him, so long as he doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">not believe any thing unworthy of Thee, O Lord, the Creator of all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it doth injure him, if he imagine it to pertain to the form of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctrine of piety, and will yet affirm that too stiffly whereof he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is ignorant. And yet is even such an infirmity, in the infancy of</p>
<p class="calibre1">faith, borne by our mother Charity, till the new-born may grow up unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">a perfect man, so as not to be carried about with every wind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctrine. But in him who in such wise presumed to be the teacher,</p>
<p class="calibre1">source, guide, chief of all whom he could so persuade, that whoso</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed him thought that he followed, not a mere man, but Thy Holy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit; who would not judge that so great madness, when once convicted</p>
<p class="calibre1">of having taught any thing false, were to be detested and utterly</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejected? But I had not as yet clearly ascertained whether the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vicissitudes of longer and shorter days and nights, and of day and</p>
<p class="calibre1">night itself, with the eclipses of the greater lights, and whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">else of the kind I had read of in other books, might be explained</p>
<p class="calibre1">consistently with his sayings; so that, if they by any means might, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">should still remain a question to me whether it were so or no; but I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might, on account of his reputed sanctity, rest my credence upon his</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And for almost all those nine years, wherein with unsettled mind I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been their disciple, I had longed but too intensely for the coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">of this Faustus. For the rest of the sect, whom by chance I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">lighted upon, when unable to solve my objections about these things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">still held out to me the coming of this Faustus, by conference with</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom these and greater difficulties, if I had them, were to be most</p>
<p class="calibre1">readily and abundantly cleared. When then he came, I found him a man</p>
<p class="calibre1">of pleasing discourse, and who could speak fluently and in better</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms, yet still but the self-same things which they were wont to say.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what availed the utmost neatness of the cup-bearer to my thirst</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a more precious draught? Mine ears were already cloyed with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">like, nor did they seem to me therefore better, because better said;</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor therefore true, because eloquent; nor the soul therefore wise,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because the face was comely, and the language graceful. But they who</p>
<p class="calibre1">held him out to me were no good judges of things; and therefore to</p>
<p class="calibre1">them he appeared understanding and wise, because in words pleasing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt however that another sort of people were suspicious even of</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth, and refused to assent to it, if delivered in a smooth and</p>
<p class="calibre1">copious discourse. But Thou, O my God, hadst already taught me by</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful and secret ways, and therefore I believe that Thou taughtest</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, because it is truth, nor is there besides Thee any teacher of</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth, where or whencesoever it may shine upon us. Of Thyself</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore had I now learned, that neither ought any thing to seem to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be spoken truly, because eloquently; nor therefore falsely, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">the utterance of the lips is inharmonious; nor, again, therefore true,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because rudely delivered; nor therefore false, because the language is</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich; but that wisdom and folly are as wholesome and unwholesome food;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and adorned or unadorned phrases as courtly or country vessels; either</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of meats may be served up in either kind of dishes.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">That greediness then, wherewith I had of so long time expected</p>
<p class="calibre1">that man, was delighted verily with his action and feeling when</p>
<p class="calibre1">disputing, and his choice and readiness of words to clothe his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ideas. I was then delighted, and, with many others and more than they,</p>
<p class="calibre1">did I praise and extol him. It troubled me, however, that in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">assembly of his auditors, I was not allowed to put in and</p>
<p class="calibre1">communicate those questions that troubled me, in familiar converse</p>
<p class="calibre1">with him. Which when I might, and with my friends began to engage</p>
<p class="calibre1">his ears at such times as it was not unbecoming for him to discuss</p>
<p class="calibre1">with me, and had brought forward such things as moved me; I found</p>
<p class="calibre1">him first utterly ignorant of liberal sciences, save grammar, and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">but in an ordinary way. But because he had read some of Tully’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Orations, a very few books of Seneca, some things of the poets, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">such few volumes of his own sect as were written in Latin and</p>
<p class="calibre1">neatly, and was daily practised in speaking, he acquired a certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">eloquence, which proved the more pleasing and seductive because</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the guidance of a good wit, and with a kind of natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">gracefulness. Is it not thus, as I recall it, O Lord my God, Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">judge of my conscience? before Thee is my heart, and my remembrance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Who didst at that time direct me by the hidden mystery of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">providence, and didst set those shameful errors of mine before my</p>
<p class="calibre1">face, that I might see and hate them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For after it was clear that he was ignorant of those arts in which I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought he excelled, I began to despair of his opening and solving the</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficulties which perplexed me (of which indeed however ignorant,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he might have held the truths of piety, had he not been a Manichee).</p>
<p class="calibre1">For their books are fraught with prolix fables, of the heaven, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stars, sun, and moon, and I now no longer thought him able</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfactorily to decide what I much desired, whether, on comparison</p>
<p class="calibre1">of these things with the calculations I had elsewhere read, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">account given in the books of Manichaeus were preferable, or at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least as good. Which when I proposed to he considered and discussed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he, so far modestly, shrunk from the burthen. For he knew that he knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">not these things, and was not ashamed to confess it. For he was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">one of those talking persons, many of whom I had endured, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">undertook to teach me these things, and said nothing. But this man had</p>
<p class="calibre1">a heart, though not right towards Thee, yet neither altogether</p>
<p class="calibre1">treacherous to himself. For he was not altogether ignorant of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own ignorance, nor would he rashly be entangled in a dispute, whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">he could neither retreat nor extricate himself fairly. Even for this I</p>
<p class="calibre1">liked him the better. For fairer is the modesty of a candid mind, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the knowledge of those things which I desired; and such I found him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in all the more difficult and subtile questions.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">My zeal for the writings of Manichaeus being thus blunted, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">despairing yet more of their other teachers, seeing that in divers</p>
<p class="calibre1">things which perplexed me, he, so renowned among them, had so turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">out; I began to engage with him in the study of that literature, on</p>
<p class="calibre1">which he also was much set (and which as rhetoric-reader I was at that</p>
<p class="calibre1">time teaching young students at Carthage), and to read with him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">either what himself desired to hear, or such as I judged fit for his</p>
<p class="calibre1">genius. But all my efforts whereby I had purposed to advance in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sect, upon knowledge of that man, came utterly to an end; not that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">detached myself from them altogether, but as one finding nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">better, I had settled to be content meanwhile with what I had in</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever way fallen upon, unless by chance something more eligible</p>
<p class="calibre1">should dawn upon me. Thus, that Faustus, to so many a snare of</p>
<p class="calibre1">death, had now neither willing nor witting it, begun to loosen that</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherein I was taken. For Thy hands, O my God, in the secret purpose of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy providence, did not forsake my soul; and out of my mother’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart’s blood, through her tears night and day poured out, was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrifice offered for me unto Thee; and Thou didst deal with me by</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondrous ways. Thou didst it, O my God: for the steps of a man are</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordered by the Lord, and He shall dispose his way. Or how shall we</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtain salvation, but from Thy hand, re-making what it made?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou didst deal with me, that I should be persuaded to go to Rome,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and to teach there rather, what I was teaching at Carthage. And how</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was persuaded to this, I will not neglect to confess to Thee;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because herein also the deepest recesses of Thy wisdom, and Thy most</p>
<p class="calibre1">present mercy to us, must be considered and confessed. I did not</p>
<p class="calibre1">wish therefore to go to Rome, because higher gains and higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">dignities were warranted me by my friends who persuaded me to this</p>
<p class="calibre1">(though even these things had at that time an influence over my mind),</p>
<p class="calibre1">but my chief and almost only reason was, that I heard that young men</p>
<p class="calibre1">studied there more peacefully, and were kept quiet under a restraint</p>
<p class="calibre1">of more regular discipline; so that they did not, at their</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasures, petulantly rush into the school of one whose pupils they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were not, nor were even admitted without his permission. Whereas at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carthage there reigns among the scholars a most disgraceful and unruly</p>
<p class="calibre1">licence. They burst in audaciously, and with gestures almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">frantic, disturb all order which any one hath established for the good</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his scholars. Divers outrages they commit, with a wonderful</p>
<p class="calibre1">stolidity, punishable by law, did not custom uphold them; that</p>
<p class="calibre1">custom evincing them to be the more miserable, in that they now do</p>
<p class="calibre1">as lawful what by Thy eternal law shall never be lawful; and they</p>
<p class="calibre1">think they do it unpunished, whereas they are punished with the very</p>
<p class="calibre1">blindness whereby they do it, and suffer incomparably worse than</p>
<p class="calibre1">what they do. The manners then which, when a student, I would not make</p>
<p class="calibre1">my own, I was fain as a teacher to endure in others: and so I was well</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased to go where, all that knew it, assured me that the like was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not done. But Thou, my refuge and my portion in the land of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">living; that I might change my earthly dwelling for the salvation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my soul, at Carthage didst goad me, that I might thereby be torn</p>
<p class="calibre1">from it; and at Rome didst proffer me allurements, whereby I might</p>
<p class="calibre1">be drawn thither, by men in love with a dying life, the one doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">frantic, the other promising vain, things; and, to correct my steps,</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst secretly use their and my own perverseness. For both they who</p>
<p class="calibre1">disturbed my quiet were blinded with a disgraceful frenzy, and they</p>
<p class="calibre1">who invited me elsewhere savoured of earth. And I, who here detested</p>
<p class="calibre1">real misery, was there seeking unreal happiness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But why I went hence, and went thither, Thou knewest, O God, yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">showedst it neither to me, nor to my mother, who grievously bewailed</p>
<p class="calibre1">my journey, and followed me as far as the sea. But I deceived her,</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding me by force, that either she might keep me back or go with me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I feigned that I had a friend whom I could not leave, till he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had a fair wind to sail. And I lied to my mother, and such a mother,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and escaped: for this also hast Thou mercifully forgiven me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">preserving me, thus full of execrable defilements, from the waters</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the sea, for the water of Thy Grace; whereby when I was cleansed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the streams of my mother’s eyes should be dried, with which for me she</p>
<p class="calibre1">daily watered the ground under her face. And yet refusing to return</p>
<p class="calibre1">without me, I scarcely persuaded her to stay that night in a place</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard by our ship, where was an Oratory in memory of the blessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyprian. That night I privily departed, but she was not behind in</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeping and prayer. And what, O Lord, was she with so many tears</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking of Thee, but that Thou wouldest not suffer me to sail? But</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, in the depth of Thy counsels and hearing the main point of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire, regardest not what she then asked, that Thou mightest make</p>
<p class="calibre1">me what she ever asked. The wind blew and swelled our sails, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">withdrew the shore from our sight; and she on the morrow was there,</p>
<p class="calibre1">frantic with sorrow, and with complaints and groans filled Thine ears,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Who didst then disregard them; whilst through my desires, Thou wert</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurrying me to end all desire, and the earthly part of her affection</p>
<p class="calibre1">to me was chastened by the allotted scourge of sorrows. For she</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved my being with her, as mothers do, but much more than many; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">she knew not how great joy Thou wert about to work for her out of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">absence. She knew not; therefore did she weep and wail, and by this</p>
<p class="calibre1">agony there appeared in her the inheritance of Eve, with sorrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeking what in sorrow she had brought forth. And yet, after</p>
<p class="calibre1">accusing my treachery and hardheartedness, she betook herself again to</p>
<p class="calibre1">intercede to Thee for me, went to her wonted place, and I to Rome.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And lo, there was I received by the scourge of bodily sickness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I was going down to hell, carrying all the sins which I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">committed, both against Thee, and myself, and others, many and</p>
<p class="calibre1">grievous, over and above that bond of original sin, whereby we all die</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Adam. For Thou hadst not forgiven me any of these things in Christ,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor had He abolished by His Cross the enmity which by my sins I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">incurred with Thee. For how should He, by the crucifixion of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">phantasm, which I believed Him to be? So true, then, was the death</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my soul, as that of His flesh seemed to me false; and how true</p>
<p class="calibre1">the death of His body, so false was the life of my soul, which did not</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe it. And now the fever heightening, I was parting and departing</p>
<p class="calibre1">for ever. For had I then parted hence, whither had I departed, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">into fire and torments, such as my misdeeds deserved in the truth of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy appointment? And this she knew not, yet in absence prayed for</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. But Thou, everywhere present, heardest her where she was, and,</p>
<p class="calibre1">where I was, hadst compassion upon me; that I should recover the</p>
<p class="calibre1">health of my body, though frenzied as yet in my sacrilegious heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For I did not in all that danger desire Thy baptism; and I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">better as a boy, when I begged it of my mother’s piety, as I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">before recited and confessed. But I had grown up to my own shame,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I madly scoffed at the prescripts of Thy medicine, who wouldest</p>
<p class="calibre1">not suffer me, being such, to die a double death. With which wound had</p>
<p class="calibre1">my mother’s heart been pierced, it could never be healed. For I cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">express the affection she bore to me, and with how much more</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehement anguish she was now in labour of me in the spirit, than at</p>
<p class="calibre1">her childbearing in the flesh.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I see not then how she should have been healed, had such a death</p>
<p class="calibre1">of mine stricken through the bowels of her love. And where would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have been those her so strong and unceasing prayers, unintermitting to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee alone? But wouldest Thou, God of mercies, despise the contrite</p>
<p class="calibre1">and humbled heart of that chaste and sober widow, so frequent in</p>
<p class="calibre1">almsdeeds, so full of duty and service to Thy saints, no day</p>
<p class="calibre1">intermitting the oblation at Thine altar, twice a day, morning and</p>
<p class="calibre1">evening, without any intermission, coming to Thy church, not for</p>
<p class="calibre1">idle tattlings and old wives’ fables; but that she might hear Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thy discourses, and Thou her in her prayers. Couldest Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">despise and reject from Thy aid the tears of such an one, wherewith</p>
<p class="calibre1">she begged of Thee not gold or silver, nor any mutable or passing</p>
<p class="calibre1">good, but the salvation of her son’s soul? Thou, by whose gift she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">such? Never, Lord. Yea, Thou wert at hand, and wert hearing and doing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that order wherein Thou hadst determined before that it should be</p>
<p class="calibre1">done. Far be it that Thou shouldest deceive her in Thy visions and</p>
<p class="calibre1">answers, some whereof I have, some I have not mentioned, which she</p>
<p class="calibre1">laid up in her faithful heart, and ever praying, urged upon Thee, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thine own handwriting. For Thou, because Thy mercy endureth for</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever, vouchsafest to those to whom Thou forgivest all of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">debts, to become also a debtor by Thy promises.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou recoveredst me then of that sickness, and healedst the son of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy handmaid, for the time in body, that he might live, for Thee to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bestow upon him a better and more abiding health. And even then, at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rome, I joined myself to those deceiving and deceived “holy ones”; not</p>
<p class="calibre1">with their disciples only (of which number was he, in whose house I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had fallen sick and recovered); but also with those whom they call</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Elect.” For I still thought “that it was not we that sin, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I know not what other nature sinned in us”; and it delighted my</p>
<p class="calibre1">pride, to be free from blame; and when I had done any evil, not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess I had done any, that Thou mightest heal my soul because it had</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinned against Thee: but I loved to excuse it, and to accuse I know</p>
<p class="calibre1">not what other thing, which was with me, but which I was not. But in</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth it was wholly I, and mine impiety had divided me against myself:</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that sin was the more incurable, whereby I did not judge myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">a sinner; and execrable iniquity it was, that I had rather have</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, Thee, O God Almighty, to be overcome in me to my destruction,</p>
<p class="calibre1">than myself of Thee to salvation. Not as yet then hadst Thou set a</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch before my mouth, and a door of safe keeping around my lips, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">my heart might not turn aside to wicked speeches, to make excuses of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sins, with men that work iniquity; and, therefore, was I still</p>
<p class="calibre1">united with their Elect.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now despairing to make proficiency in that false doctrine,</p>
<p class="calibre1">even those things (with which if I should find no better, I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolved to rest contented) I now held more laxly and carelessly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For there half arose a thought in me that those philosophers, whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">they call Academics, were wiser than the rest, for that they held</p>
<p class="calibre1">men ought to doubt everything, and laid down that no truth can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehended by man: for so, not then understanding even their</p>
<p class="calibre1">meaning, I also was clearly convinced that they thought, as they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonly reported. Yet did I freely and openly discourage that host of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine from that over-confidence which I perceived him to have in</p>
<p class="calibre1">those fables, which the books of Manichaeus are full of. Yet I lived</p>
<p class="calibre1">in more familiar friendship with them, than with others who were not</p>
<p class="calibre1">of this heresy. Nor did I maintain it with my ancient eagerness; still</p>
<p class="calibre1">my intimacy with that sect (Rome secretly harbouring many of them)</p>
<p class="calibre1">made me slower to seek any other way: especially since I despaired</p>
<p class="calibre1">of finding the truth, from which they had turned me aside, in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church, O Lord of heaven and earth, Creator of all things visible</p>
<p class="calibre1">and invisible: and it seemed to me very unseemly to believe Thee to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have the shape of human flesh, and to be bounded by the bodily</p>
<p class="calibre1">lineaments of our members. And because, when I wished to think on my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, I knew not what to think of, but a mass of bodies (for what was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not such did not seem to me to be anything), this was the greatest,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and almost only cause of my inevitable error.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For hence I believed Evil also to be some such kind of substance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and to have its own foul and hideous bulk; whether gross, which they</p>
<p class="calibre1">called earth, or thin and subtile (like the body of the air), which</p>
<p class="calibre1">they imagine to be some malignant mind, creeping through that earth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And because a piety, such as it was, constrained me to believe that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the good God never created any evil nature, I conceived two masses,</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrary to one another, both unbounded, but the evil narrower, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">good more expansive. And from this pestilent beginning, the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrilegious conceits followed on me. For when my mind endeavoured</p>
<p class="calibre1">to recur to the Catholic faith, I was driven back, since that was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not the Catholic faith which I thought to be so. And I seemed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself more reverential, if I believed of Thee, my God (to whom Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">mercies confess out of my mouth), as unbounded, at least on other</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides, although on that one where the mass of evil was opposed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, I was constrained to confess Thee bounded; than if on all</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides I should imagine Thee to be bounded by the form of a human body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it seemed to me better to believe Thee to have created no evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">(which to me ignorant seemed not some only, but a bodily substance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because I could not conceive of mind unless as a subtile body, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that diffused in definite spaces), than to believe the nature of evil,</p>
<p class="calibre1">such as I conceived it, could come from Thee. Yea, and our Saviour</p>
<p class="calibre1">Himself, Thy Only Begotten, I believed to have been reached forth</p>
<p class="calibre1">(as it were) for our salvation, out of the mass of Thy most lucid</p>
<p class="calibre1">substance, so as to believe nothing of Him, but what I could imagine</p>
<p class="calibre1">in my vanity. His Nature then, being such, I thought could not be born</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Virgin Mary, without being mingled with the flesh: and how that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which I had so figured to myself could be mingled, and not defiled,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I saw not. I feared therefore to believe Him born in the flesh, lest I</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be forced to believe Him defiled by the flesh. Now will Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual ones mildly and lovingly smile upon me, if they shall read</p>
<p class="calibre1">these my confessions. Yet such was I.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, what the Manichees had criticised in Thy Scriptures,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought could not be defended; yet at times verily I had a wish to</p>
<p class="calibre1">confer upon these several points with some one very well skilled in</p>
<p class="calibre1">those books, and to make trial what he thought thereon; for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">words of one Helpidius, as he spoke and disputed face to face</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the said Manichees, had begun to stir me even at Carthage:</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that he had produced things out of the Scriptures, not easily</p>
<p class="calibre1">withstood, the Manichees’ answer whereto seemed to me weak. And this</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer they liked not to give publicly, but only to us in private.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was, that the Scriptures of the New Testament had been corrupted by</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know not whom, who wished to engraff the law of the Jews upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian faith: yet themselves produced not any uncorrupted copies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I, conceiving of things corporeal only, was mainly held down,</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehemently oppressed and in a manner suffocated by those “masses”;</p>
<p class="calibre1">panting under which after the breath of Thy truth, I could not breathe</p>
<p class="calibre1">it pure and untainted.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I began then diligently to practise that for which I came to Rome,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to teach rhetoric; and first, to gather some to my house, to whom, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">through whom, I had begun to be known; when to, I found other offences</p>
<p class="calibre1">committed in Rome, to which I was not exposed in Africa. True, those</p>
<p class="calibre1">“subvertings” by profligate young men were not here practised, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">was told me: but on a sudden, said they, to avoid paying their</p>
<p class="calibre1">master’s stipend, a number of youths plot together, and remove to</p>
<p class="calibre1">another; -breakers of faith, who for love of money hold justice cheap.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These also my heart hated, though not with a perfect hatred: for</p>
<p class="calibre1">perchance I hated them more because I was to suffer by them, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">because they did things utterly unlawful. Of a truth such are base</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons, and they go a whoring from Thee, loving these fleeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">mockeries of things temporal, and filthy lucre, which fouls the hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">that grasps it; hugging the fleeting world, and despising Thee, Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">abidest, and recallest, and forgivest the adulteress soul of man, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">she returns to Thee. And now I hate such depraved and crooked persons,</p>
<p class="calibre1">though I love them if corrigible, so as to prefer to money the</p>
<p class="calibre1">learning which they acquire, and to learning, Thee, O God, the truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and fulness of assured good, and most pure peace. But then I rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">for my own sake misliked them evil, than liked and wished them good</p>
<p class="calibre1">for Thine.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">When therefore they of Milan had sent to Rome to the prefect of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the city, to furnish them with a rhetoric reader for their city, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sent him at the public expense, I made application (through those very</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons, intoxicated with Manichaean vanities, to be freed wherefrom I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was to go, neither of us however knowing it) that Symmachus, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">prefect of the city, would try me by setting me some subject, and so</p>
<p class="calibre1">send me. To Milan I came, to Ambrose the Bishop, known to the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">world as among the best of men, Thy devout servant; whose eloquent</p>
<p class="calibre1">discourse did then plentifully dispense unto Thy people the flour of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy wheat, the gladness of Thy oil, and the sober inebriation of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">wine. To him was I unknowing led by Thee, that by him I might</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowingly be led to Thee. That man of God received me as a father, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed me an Episcopal kindness on my coming. Thenceforth I began to</p>
<p class="calibre1">love him, at first indeed not as a teacher of the truth (which I</p>
<p class="calibre1">utterly despaired of in Thy Church), but as a person kind towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself. And I listened diligently to him preaching to the people,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not with that intent I ought, but, as it were, trying his eloquence,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether it answered the fame thereof, or flowed fuller or lower than</p>
<p class="calibre1">was reported; and I hung on his words attentively; but of the matter I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was as a careless and scornful looker-on; and I was delighted with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweetness of his discourse, more recondite, yet in manner less winning</p>
<p class="calibre1">and harmonious, than that of Faustus. Of the matter, however, there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was no comparison; for the one was wandering amid Manichaean</p>
<p class="calibre1">delusions, the other teaching salvation most soundly. But salvation is</p>
<p class="calibre1">far from sinners, such as I then stood before him; and yet was I</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing nearer by little and little, and unconsciously.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For though I took no pains to learn what he spake, but only to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear how he spake (for that empty care alone was left me, despairing</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a way, open for man, to Thee), yet together with the words which</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would choose, came also into my mind the things which I would</p>
<p class="calibre1">refuse; for I could not separate them. And while I opened my heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">to admit “how eloquently he spake,” there also entered “how truly he</p>
<p class="calibre1">spake”; but this by degrees. For first, these things also had now</p>
<p class="calibre1">begun to appear to me capable of defence; and the Catholic faith,</p>
<p class="calibre1">for which I had thought nothing could be said against the Manichees’</p>
<p class="calibre1">objections, I now thought might be maintained without shamelessness;</p>
<p class="calibre1">especially after I had heard one or two places of the Old Testament</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolved, and ofttimes “in a figure,” which when I understood</p>
<p class="calibre1">literally, I was slain spiritually. Very many places then of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">books having been explained, I now blamed my despair, in believing</p>
<p class="calibre1">that no answer could be given to such as hated and scoffed at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Law and the Prophets. Yet did I not therefore then see that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Catholic way was to be held, because it also could find learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintainers, who could at large and with some show of reason answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">objections; nor that what I held was therefore to be condemned,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because both sides could be maintained. For the Catholic cause</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed to me in such sort not vanquished, as still not as yet to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">victorious.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hereupon I earnestly bent my mind, to see if in any way I could by</p>
<p class="calibre1">any certain proof convict the Manichees of falsehood. Could I once</p>
<p class="calibre1">have conceived a spiritual substance, all their strongholds had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten down, and cast utterly out of my mind; but I could not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding, concerning the frame of this world, and the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">of nature, which the senses of the flesh can reach to, as I more and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more considered and compared things, I judged the tenets of most of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the philosophers to have been much more probable. So then after the</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner of the Academics (as they are supposed) doubting of every</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, and wavering between all, I settled so far, that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manichees were to be abandoned; judging that, even while doubting, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might not continue in that sect, to which I already preferred some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the philosophers; to which philosophers notwithstanding, for that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they were without the saving Name of Christ, I utterly refused to</p>
<p class="calibre1">commit the cure of my sick soul. I determined therefore so long to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a Catechumen in the Catholic Church, to which I had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">commended by my parents, till something certain should dawn upon me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whither I might steer my course.</p>
