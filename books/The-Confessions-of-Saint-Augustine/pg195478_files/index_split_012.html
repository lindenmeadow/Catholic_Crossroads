<h2 id="calibre_toc_9" class="calibre7">BOOK VIII</h2><p class="calibre1">O my God, let me, with thanksgiving, remember, and confess unto Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy mercies on me. Let my bones be bedewed with Thy love, and let them</p>
<p class="calibre1">say unto Thee, Who is like unto Thee, O Lord? Thou hast broken my</p>
<p class="calibre1">bonds in sunder, I will offer unto Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And how Thou hast broken them, I will declare; and all who worship</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, when they hear this, shall say, “Blessed be the Lord, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven and in earth, great and wonderful is his name. ” Thy words</p>
<p class="calibre1">had stuck fast in my heart, and I was hedged round about on all</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides by Thee. Of Thy eternal life I was now certain, though I saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">it in a figure and as through a glass. Yet I had ceased to doubt</p>
<p class="calibre1">that there was an incorruptible substance, whence was all other</p>
<p class="calibre1">substance; nor did I now desire to be more certain of Thee, but more</p>
<p class="calibre1">steadfast in Thee. But for my temporal life, all was wavering, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">my heart had to be purged from the old leaven. The Way, the Saviour</p>
<p class="calibre1">Himself, well pleased me, but as yet I shrunk from going through its</p>
<p class="calibre1">straitness. And Thou didst put into my mind, and it seemed good in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my eyes, to go to Simplicianus, who seemed to me a good servant of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thine; and Thy grace shone in him. I had heard also that from his very</p>
<p class="calibre1">youth he had lived most devoted unto Thee. Now he was grown into</p>
<p class="calibre1">years; and by reason of so great age spent in such zealous following</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thy ways, he seemed to me likely to have learned much experience;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and so he had. Out of which store I wished that he would tell me</p>
<p class="calibre1">(setting before him my anxieties) which were the fittest way for one</p>
<p class="calibre1">in my case to walk in Thy paths.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For, I saw the church full; and one went this way, and another</p>
<p class="calibre1">that way. But I was displeased that I led a secular life; yea now that</p>
<p class="calibre1">my desires no longer inflamed me, as of old, with hopes of honour</p>
<p class="calibre1">and profit, a very grievous burden it was to undergo so heavy a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bondage. For, in comparison of Thy sweetness, and the beauty of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">house which I loved, those things delighted me no longer. But still</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was enthralled with the love of woman; nor did the Apostle forbid me</p>
<p class="calibre1">to marry, although he advised me to something better, chiefly</p>
<p class="calibre1">wishing that all men were as himself was. But I being weak, chose</p>
<p class="calibre1">the more indulgent place; and because of this alone, was tossed up and</p>
<p class="calibre1">down in all beside, faint and wasted with withering cares, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">in other matters I was constrained against my will to conform myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">to a married life, to which I was given up and enthralled. I had heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the mouth of the Truth, that there were some eunuchs which had</p>
<p class="calibre1">made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake: but, saith</p>
<p class="calibre1">He, let him who can receive it, receive it. Surely vain are all men</p>
<p class="calibre1">who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things which</p>
<p class="calibre1">are seen, find out Him who is good. But I was no longer in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanity; I had surmounted it; and by the common witness of all Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">creatures had found Thee our Creator, and Thy Word, God with Thee, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">together with Thee one God, by whom Thou createdst all things. There</p>
<p class="calibre1">is yet another kind of ungodly, who knowing God, glorified Him not</p>
<p class="calibre1">as God, neither were thankful. Into this also had I fallen, but Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">right hand upheld me, and took me thence, and Thou placedst me where I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might recover. For Thou hast said unto man, Behold, the fear of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord is wisdom, and, Desire not to seem wise; because they who</p>
<p class="calibre1">affirmed themselves to be wise, became fools. But I had now found</p>
<p class="calibre1">the goodly pearl, which, selling all that I had, I ought to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">bought, and I hesitated.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Simplicianus then I went, the father of Ambrose (a Bishop now) in</p>
<p class="calibre1">receiving Thy grace, and whom Ambrose truly loved as a father. To</p>
<p class="calibre1">him I related the mazes of my wanderings. But when I mentioned that</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had read certain books of the Platonists, which Victorinus, sometime</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rhetoric Professor of Rome (who had died a Christian, as I had heard),</p>
<p class="calibre1">had translated into Latin, he testified his joy that I had not</p>
<p class="calibre1">fallen upon the writings of other philosophers, full of fallacies</p>
<p class="calibre1">and deceits, after the rudiments of this world, whereas the Platonists</p>
<p class="calibre1">many ways led to the belief in God and His Word. Then to exhort me</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the humility of Christ, hidden from the wise, and revealed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">little ones, he spoke of Victorinus himself, whom while at Rome he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">most intimately known: and of him he related what I will not</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceal. For it contains great praise of Thy grace, to be confessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thee, how that aged man, most learned and skilled in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">liberal sciences, and who had read, and weighed so many works of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">philosophers; the instructor of so many noble Senators, who also, as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">monument of his excellent discharge of his office, had (which men of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this world esteem a high honour) both deserved and obtained a statue</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the Roman Forum; he, to that age a worshipper of idols, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">partaker of the sacrilegious rites, to which almost all the nobility</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Rome were given up, and had inspired the people with the love of</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">Anubis, barking Deity, and all</p>
<p class="calibre4">The monster Gods of every kind, who fought</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘Gainst Neptune, Venus, and Minerva:</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">whom Rome once conquered, now adored, all which the aged Victorinus</p>
<p class="calibre1">had with thundering eloquence so many years defended; -he now</p>
<p class="calibre1">blushed not to be the child of Thy Christ, and the new-born babe of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy fountain; submitting his neck to the yoke of humility, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">subduing his forehead to the reproach of the Cross.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O Lord, Lord, Which hast bowed the heavens and come down, touched</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mountains and they did smoke, by what means didst Thou convey</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyself into that breast? He used to read (as Simplicianus said) the</p>
<p class="calibre1">holy Scripture, most studiously sought and searched into all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian writings, and said to Simplicianus (not openly, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">privately and as a friend), “Understand that I am already a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian.” Whereto he answered, “I will not believe it, nor will I</p>
<p class="calibre1">rank you among Christians, unless I see you in the Church of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ.” The other, in banter, replied, “Do walls then make</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christians?” And this he often said, that he was already a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian; and Simplicianus as often made the same answer, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceit of the “walls” was by the other as often renewed. For he</p>
<p class="calibre1">feared to offend his friends, proud daemon-worshippers, from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">height of whose Babylonian dignity, as from cedars of Libanus, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lord had not yet broken down, he supposed the weight of enmity</p>
<p class="calibre1">would fall upon him. But after that by reading and earnest thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">he had gathered firmness, and feared to be denied by Christ before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">holy angels, should he now be afraid to confess Him before men, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared to himself guilty of a heavy offence, in being ashamed of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sacraments of the humility of Thy Word, and not being ashamed of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrilegious rites of those proud daemons, whose pride he had imitated</p>
<p class="calibre1">and their rites adopted, he became bold-faced against vanity, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shame-faced towards the truth, and suddenly and unexpectedly said to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simplicianus (as himself told me), “Go we to the Church; I wish to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be made a Christian.” But he, not containing himself for joy, went</p>
<p class="calibre1">with him. And having been admitted to the first Sacrament and become a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Catechumen, not long after he further gave in his name, that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be regenerated by baptism, Rome wondering, the Church rejoicing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The proud saw, and were wroth; they gnashed with their teeth, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">melted away. But the Lord God was the hope of Thy servant, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">regarded not vanities and lying madness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">To conclude, when the hour was come for making profession of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">faith (which at Rome they, who are about to approach to Thy grace,</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliver, from an elevated place, in the sight of all the faithful,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a set form of words committed to memory), the presbyters, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said, offered Victorinus (as was done to such as seemed likely through</p>
<p class="calibre1">bashfulness to be alarmed) to make his profession more privately:</p>
<p class="calibre1">but he chose rather to profess his salvation in the presence of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">holy multitude. “For it was not salvation that he taught in</p>
<p class="calibre1">rhetoric, and yet that he had publicly professed: how much less then</p>
<p class="calibre1">ought he, when pronouncing Thy word, to dread Thy meek flock, who,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when delivering his own words, had not feared a mad multitude!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">When, then, he went up to make his profession, all, as they knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, whispered his name one to another with the voice of</p>
<p class="calibre1">congratulation. And who there knew him not? and there ran a low murmur</p>
<p class="calibre1">through all the mouths of the rejoicing multitude, Victorinus!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Victorinus! Sudden was the burst of rapture, that they saw him;</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly were they hushed that they might hear him. He pronounced</p>
<p class="calibre1">the true faith with an excellent boldness, and all wished to draw</p>
<p class="calibre1">him into their very heart; yea by their love and joy they drew him</p>
<p class="calibre1">thither, such were the hands wherewith they drew him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good God! what takes place in man, that he should more rejoice at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the salvation of a soul despaired of, and freed from greater peril,</p>
<p class="calibre1">than if there had always been hope of him, or the danger had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">less? For so Thou also, merciful Father, dost more rejoice over one</p>
<p class="calibre1">penitent than over ninety-nine just persons that need no repentance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And with much joyfulness do we hear, so often as we hear with what joy</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sheep which had strayed is brought back upon the shepherd’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder, and the groat is restored to Thy treasury, the neighbours</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejoicing with the woman who found it; and the joy of the solemn</p>
<p class="calibre1">service of Thy house forceth to tears, when in Thy house it is read of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy younger son, that he was dead, and liveth again; had been lost,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and is found. For Thou rejoicest in us, and in Thy holy angels, holy</p>
<p class="calibre1">through holy charity. For Thou art ever the same; for all things which</p>
<p class="calibre1">abide not the same nor for ever, Thou for ever knowest in the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">way.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then takes place in the soul, when it is more delighted at</p>
<p class="calibre1">finding or recovering the things it loves, than if it had ever had</p>
<p class="calibre1">them? yea, and other things witness hereunto; and all things are</p>
<p class="calibre1">full of witnesses, crying out, “So is it.” The conquering commander</p>
<p class="calibre1">triumpheth; yet had he not conquered unless he had fought; and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more peril there was in the battle, so much the more joy is there in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the triumph. The storm tosses the sailors, threatens shipwreck; all</p>
<p class="calibre1">wax pale at approaching death; sky and sea are calmed, and they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceeding joyed, as having been exceeding afraid. A friend is sick,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and his pulse threatens danger; all who long for his recovery are sick</p>
<p class="calibre1">in mind with him. He is restored, though as yet he walks not with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his former strength; yet there is such joy, as was not, when before he</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked sound and strong. Yea, the very pleasures of human life men</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquire by difficulties, not those only which fall upon us unlooked</p>
<p class="calibre1">for, and against our wills, but even by self-chosen, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure-seeking trouble. Eating and drinking have no pleasure, unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">there precede the pinching of hunger and thirst. Men, given to</p>
<p class="calibre1">drink, eat certain salt meats, to procure a troublesome heat, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">the drink allaying, causes pleasure. It is also ordered that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">affianced bride should not at once be given, lest as a husband he</p>
<p class="calibre1">should hold cheap whom, as betrothed, he sighed not after.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This law holds in foul and accursed joy; this in permitted and</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawful joy; this in the very purest perfection of friendship; this, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">him who was dead, and lived again; had been lost and was found.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every where the greater joy is ushered in by the greater pain. What</p>
<p class="calibre1">means this, O Lord my God, whereas Thou art everlastingly joy to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyself, and some things around Thee evermore rejoice in Thee? What</p>
<p class="calibre1">means this, that this portion of things thus ebbs and flows</p>
<p class="calibre1">alternately displeased and reconciled? Is this their allotted measure?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Is this all Thou hast assigned to them, whereas from the highest</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavens to the lowest earth, from the beginning of the world to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of ages, from the angel to the worm, from the first motion to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the last, Thou settest each in its place, and realisest each in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their season, every thing good after its kind? Woe is me! how high art</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou in the highest, and how deep in the deepest! and Thou never</p>
<p class="calibre1">departest, and we scarcely return to Thee.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up, Lord, and do; stir us up, and recall us; kindle and draw us;</p>
<p class="calibre1">inflame, grow sweet unto us, let us now love, let us run. Do not many,</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of a deeper hell of blindness than Victorinus, return to Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">approach, and are enlightened, receiving that Light, which they who</p>
<p class="calibre1">receive, receive power from Thee to become Thy sons? But if they be</p>
<p class="calibre1">less known to the nations, even they that know them, joy less for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. For when many joy together, each also has more exuberant joy for</p>
<p class="calibre1">that they are kindled and inflamed one by the other. Again, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">those known to many, influence the more towards salvation, and lead</p>
<p class="calibre1">the way with many to follow. And therefore do they also who preceded</p>
<p class="calibre1">them much rejoice in them, because they rejoice not in them alone. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">far be it, that in Thy tabernacle the persons of the rich should be</p>
<p class="calibre1">accepted before the poor, or the noble before the ignoble; seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather Thou hast chosen the weak things of the world to confound the</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong; and the base things of this world, and the things despised</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast Thou chosen, and those things which are not, that Thou mightest</p>
<p class="calibre1">bring to nought things that are. And yet even that least of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">apostles, by whose tongue Thou soundedst forth these words, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">through his warfare, Paulus the Proconsul, his pride conquered, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">made to pass under the easy yoke of Thy Christ, and became a</p>
<p class="calibre1">provincial of the great King; he also for his former name Saul, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased to be called Paul, in testimony of so great a victory. For the</p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy is more overcome in one, of whom he hath more hold; by whom he</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath hold of more. But the proud he hath more hold of, through their</p>
<p class="calibre1">nobility; and by them, of more through their authority. By how much</p>
<p class="calibre1">the more welcome then the heart of Victorinus was esteemed, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">the devil had held as an impregnable possession, the tongue of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Victorinus, with which mighty and keen weapon he had slain many; so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much the more abundantly ought Thy sons to rejoice, for that our</p>
<p class="calibre1">King hath bound the strong man, and they saw his vessels taken from</p>
<p class="calibre1">him and cleansed, and made meet for Thy honour; and become serviceable</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the Lord, unto every good work.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when that man of Thine, Simplicianus, related to me this of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Victorinus, I was on fire to imitate him; for for this very end had he</p>
<p class="calibre1">related it. But when he had subjoined also, how in the days of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Emperor Julian a law was made, whereby Christians were forbidden to</p>
<p class="calibre1">teach the liberal sciences or oratory; and how he, obeying this law,</p>
<p class="calibre1">chose rather to give over the wordy school than Thy Word, by which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou makest eloquent the tongues of the dumb; he seemed to me not more</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolute than blessed, in having thus found opportunity to wait on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee only. Which thing I was sighing for, bound as I was, not with</p>
<p class="calibre1">another’s irons, but by my own iron will. My will the enemy held,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and thence had made a chain for me, and bound me. For of a forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">will, was a lust made; and a lust served, became custom; and custom</p>
<p class="calibre1">not resisted, became necessity. By which links, as it were, joined</p>
<p class="calibre1">together (whence I called it a chain) a hard bondage held me</p>
<p class="calibre1">enthralled. But that new will which had begun to be in me, freely to</p>
<p class="calibre1">serve Thee, and to wish to enjoy Thee, O God, the only assured</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasantness, was not yet able to overcome my former wilfulness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">strengthened by age. Thus did my two wills, one new, and the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">old, one carnal, the other spiritual, struggle within me; and by their</p>
<p class="calibre1">discord, undid my soul.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, I understood, by my own experience, what I had read, how the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Myself verily either way; yet more myself, in that which I approved in</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself, than in that which in myself I disapproved. For in this</p>
<p class="calibre1">last, it was now for the more part not myself, because in much I</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather endured against my will, than acted willingly. And yet it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">through me that custom had obtained this power of warring against</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, because I had come willingly, whither I willed not. And who has</p>
<p class="calibre1">any right to speak against it, if just punishment follow the sinner?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor had I now any longer my former plea, that I therefore as yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">hesitated to be above the world and serve Thee, for that the truth was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not altogether ascertained to me; for now it too was. But I still</p>
<p class="calibre1">under service to the earth, refused to fight under Thy banner, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">feared as much to be freed of all incumbrances, as we should fear to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be encumbered with it. Thus with the baggage of this present world was</p>
<p class="calibre1">I held down pleasantly, as in sleep: and the thoughts wherein I</p>
<p class="calibre1">meditated on Thee were like the efforts of such as would awake, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet overcome with a heavy drowsiness, are again drenched therein.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as no one would sleep for ever, and in all men’s sober judgment</p>
<p class="calibre1">waking is better, yet a man for the most part, feeling a heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">lethargy in all his limbs, defers to shake off sleep, and though</p>
<p class="calibre1">half displeased, yet, even after it is time to rise, with pleasure</p>
<p class="calibre1">yields to it, so was I assured that much better were it for me to give</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself up to Thy charity, than to give myself over to mine own</p>
<p class="calibre1">cupidity; but though the former course satisfied me and gained the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mastery, the latter pleased me and held me mastered. Nor had I any</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing to answer Thee calling to me, Awake, thou that sleepest, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. And when Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst on all sides show me that what Thou saidst was true, I,</p>
<p class="calibre1">convicted by the truth, had nothing at all to answer, but only those</p>
<p class="calibre1">dull and drowsy words, “Anon, anon,” “presently,” “leave me but a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little.” But “presently, presently,” had no present, and my “little</p>
<p class="calibre1">while” went on for a long while; in vain I delighted in Thy law</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to the inner man, when another law in my members rebelled</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the law of my mind, and led me captive under the law of sin</p>
<p class="calibre1">which was in my members. For the law of sin is the violence of custom,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby the mind is drawn and holden, even against its will; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">deservedly, for that it willingly fell into it. Who then should</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliver me thus wretched from the body of this death, but Thy grace</p>
<p class="calibre1">only, through Jesus Christ our Lord?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And how Thou didst deliver me out of the bonds of desire,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherewith I was bound most straitly to carnal concupiscence, and out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the drudgery of worldly things, I will now declare, and confess</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thy name, O Lord, my helper and my redeemer. Amid increasing</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxiety, I was doing my wonted business, and daily sighing unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. I attended Thy Church, whenever free from the business under the</p>
<p class="calibre1">burden of which I groaned. Alypius was with me, now after the third</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting released from his law business, and awaiting to whom to sell</p>
<p class="calibre1">his counsel, as I sold the skill of speaking, if indeed teaching can</p>
<p class="calibre1">impart it. Nebridius had now, in consideration of our friendship,</p>
<p class="calibre1">consented to teach under Verecundus, a citizen and a grammarian of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Milan, and a very intimate friend of us all; who urgently desired, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the right of friendship challenged from our company, such</p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful aid as he greatly needed. Nebridius then was not drawn to</p>
<p class="calibre1">this by any desire of advantage (for he might have made much more of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his learning had he so willed), but as a most kind and gentle</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend, he would not be wanting to a good office, and slight our</p>
<p class="calibre1">request. But he acted herein very discreetly, shunning to become known</p>
<p class="calibre1">to personages great according to this world, avoiding the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distraction of mind thence ensuing, and desiring to have it free and</p>
<p class="calibre1">at leisure, as many hours as might be, to seek, or read, or hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">something concerning wisdom.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon a day then, Nebridius being absent (I recollect not why), to,</p>
<p class="calibre1">there came to see me and Alypius, one Pontitianus, our countryman so</p>
<p class="calibre1">far as being an African, in high office in the Emperor’s court. What</p>
<p class="calibre1">he would with us, I know not, but we sat down to converse, and it</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened that upon a table for some game, before us, he observed a</p>
<p class="calibre1">book, took, opened it, and contrary to his expectation, found it the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apostle Paul; for he thought it some of those books which I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing myself in teaching. Whereat smiling, and looking at me, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">expressed his joy and wonder that he had on a sudden found this</p>
<p class="calibre1">book, and this only before my eyes. For he was a Christian, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">baptised, and often bowed himself before Thee our God in the Church,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in frequent and continued prayers. When then I had told him that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">bestowed very great pains upon those Scriptures, a conversation</p>
<p class="calibre1">arose (suggested by his account) on Antony the Egyptian monk: whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">name was in high reputation among Thy servants, though to that hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">unknown to us. Which when he discovered, he dwelt the more upon that</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject, informing and wondering at our ignorance of one so eminent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But we stood amazed, hearing Thy wonderful works most fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">attested, in times so recent, and almost in our own, wrought in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">true Faith and Church Catholic. We all wondered; we, that they were so</p>
<p class="calibre1">great, and he, that they had not reached us.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thence his discourse turned to the flocks in the monasteries, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">their holy ways, a sweet-smelling savour unto Thee, and the fruitful</p>
<p class="calibre1">deserts of the wilderness, whereof we knew nothing. And there was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">monastery at Milan, full of good brethren, without the city walls,</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the fostering care of Ambrose, and we knew it not. He went on</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his discourse, and we listened in intent silence. He told us then</p>
<p class="calibre1">how one afternoon at Triers, when the Emperor was taken up with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Circensian games, he and three others, his companions, went out to</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk in gardens near the city walls, and there as they happened to</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk in pairs, one went apart with him, and the other two wandered</p>
<p class="calibre1">by themselves; and these, in their wanderings, lighted upon a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain cottage, inhabited by certain of Thy servants, poor in spirit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">of whom is the kingdom of heaven, and there they found a little book</p>
<p class="calibre1">containing the life of Antony. This one of them began to read, admire,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and kindle at it; and as he read, to meditate on taking up such a</p>
<p class="calibre1">life, and giving over his secular service to serve Thee. And these two</p>
<p class="calibre1">were of those whom they style agents for the public affairs. Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly, filled with a holy love, and a sober shame, in anger with</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself cast his eyes upon his friend, saying, “Tell me, I pray</p>
<p class="calibre1">thee, what would we attain by all these labours of ours? what aim we</p>
<p class="calibre1">at? what serve we for? Can our hopes in court rise higher than to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Emperor’s favourites? and in this, what is there not brittle,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and full of perils? and by how many perils arrive we at a greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">peril? and when arrive we thither? But a friend of God, if I wish</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, I become now at once.” So spake he. And in pain with the travail</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a new life, he turned his eyes again upon the book, and read on,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and was changed inwardly, where Thou sawest, and his mind was stripped</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the world, as soon appeared. For as he read, and rolled up and down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the waves of his heart, he stormed at himself a while, then discerned,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and determined on a better course; and now being Thine, said to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend, “Now have I broken loose from those our hopes, and am resolved</p>
<p class="calibre1">to serve God; and this, from this hour, in this place, I begin upon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If thou likest not to imitate me, oppose not.” The other answered,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he would cleave to him, to partake so glorious a reward, so glorious a</p>
<p class="calibre1">service. Thus both being now Thine, were building the tower at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary cost, the forsaking all that they had, and following Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Pontitianus and the other with him, that had walked in other</p>
<p class="calibre1">parts of the garden, came in search of them to the same place; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">finding them, reminded them to return, for the day was now far</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent. But they relating their resolution and purpose, and how that</p>
<p class="calibre1">will was begun and settled in them, begged them, if they would not</p>
<p class="calibre1">join, not to molest them. But the others, though nothing altered</p>
<p class="calibre1">from their former selves, did yet bewail themselves (as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">affirmed), and piously congratulated them, recommending themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">to their prayers; and so, with hearts lingering on the earth, went</p>
<p class="calibre1">away to the palace. But the other two, fixing their heart on heaven,</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained in the cottage. And both had affianced brides, who when</p>
<p class="calibre1">they heard hereof, also dedicated their virginity unto God.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such was the story of Pontitianus; but Thou, O Lord, while he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking, didst turn me round towards myself, taking me from behind my</p>
<p class="calibre1">back where I had placed me, unwilling to observe myself; and setting</p>
<p class="calibre1">me before my face, that I might see how foul I was, how crooked and</p>
<p class="calibre1">defiled, bespotted and ulcerous. And I beheld and stood aghast; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whither to flee from myself I found not. And if I sought to turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine eye from off myself, he went on with his relation, and Thou again</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst set me over against myself, and thrustedst me before my eyes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I might find out mine iniquity, and hate it. I had known it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but made as though I saw it not, winked at it, and forgot it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now, the more ardently I loved those whose healthful</p>
<p class="calibre1">affections I heard of, that they had resigned themselves wholly to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee to be cured, the more did I abhor myself, when compared with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. For many of my years (some twelve) had now run out with me since</p>
<p class="calibre1">my nineteenth, when, upon the reading of Cicero’s Hortensius, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">stirred to an earnest love of wisdom; and still I was deferring to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reject mere earthly felicity, and give myself to search out that,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereof not the finding only, but the very search, was to be preferred</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the treasures and kingdoms of the world, though already found,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and to the pleasures of the body, though spread around me at my</p>
<p class="calibre1">will. But I wretched, most wretched, in the very commencement of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">early youth, had begged chastity of Thee, and said, “Give me</p>
<p class="calibre1">chastity and continency, only not yet.” For I feared lest Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldest hear me soon, and soon cure me of the disease of</p>
<p class="calibre1">concupiscence, which I wished to have satisfied, rather than</p>
<p class="calibre1">extinguished. And I had wandered through crooked ways in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrilegious superstition, not indeed assured thereof, but as</p>
<p class="calibre1">preferring it to the others which I did not seek religiously, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposed maliciously.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I had thought that I therefore deferred from day to day to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reject the hopes of this world, and follow Thee only, because there</p>
<p class="calibre1">did not appear aught certain, whither to direct my course. And now was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the day come wherein I was to be laid bare to myself, and my</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscience was to upbraid me. “Where art thou now, my tongue? Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">saidst that for an uncertain truth thou likedst not to cast off the</p>
<p class="calibre1">baggage of vanity; now, it is certain, and yet that burden still</p>
<p class="calibre1">oppresseth thee, while they who neither have so worn themselves out</p>
<p class="calibre1">with seeking it, nor for often years and more have been thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereon, have had their shoulders lightened, and received wings to fly</p>
<p class="calibre1">away.” Thus was I gnawed within, and exceedingly confounded with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">horrible shame, while Pontitianus was so speaking. And he having</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought to a close his tale and the business he came for, went his</p>
<p class="calibre1">way; and I into myself. What said I not against myself? with what</p>
<p class="calibre1">scourges of condemnation lashed I not my soul, that it might follow</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, striving to go after Thee! Yet it drew back; refused, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">excused not itself. All arguments were spent and confuted; there</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained a mute shrinking; and she feared, as she would death, to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">restrained from the flux of that custom, whereby she was wasting to</p>
<p class="calibre1">death.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then in this great contention of my inward dwelling, which I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">strongly raised against my soul, in the chamber of my heart,</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubled in mind and countenance, I turned upon Alypius. “What ails</p>
<p class="calibre1">us?” I exclaim: “what is it? what heardest thou? The unlearned start</p>
<p class="calibre1">up and take heaven by force, and we with our learning, and without</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, to, where we wallow in flesh and blood! Are we ashamed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow, because others are gone before, and not ashamed not even to</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow?” Some such words I uttered, and my fever of mind tore me</p>
<p class="calibre1">away from him, while he, gazing on me in astonishment, kept silence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For it was not my wonted tone; and my forehead, cheeks, eyes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">colour, tone of voice, spake my mind more than the words I uttered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A little garden there was to our lodging, which we had the use of,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as of the whole house; for the master of the house, our host, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not living there. Thither had the tumult of my breast hurried me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">where no man might hinder the hot contention wherein I had engaged</p>
<p class="calibre1">with myself, until it should end as Thou knewest, I knew not. Only I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was healthfully distracted and dying, to live; knowing what evil thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was, and not knowing what good thing I was shortly to become. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">retired then into the garden, and Alypius, on my steps. For his</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence did not lessen my privacy; or how could he forsake me so</p>
<p class="calibre1">disturbed? We sate down as far removed as might be from the house. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was troubled in spirit, most vehemently indignant that I entered not</p>
<p class="calibre1">into Thy will and covenant, O my God, which all my bones cried out</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto me to enter, and praised it to the skies. And therein we enter</p>
<p class="calibre1">not by ships, or chariots, or feet, no, move not so far as I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come from the house to that place where we were sitting. For, not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go only, but to go in thither was nothing else but to will to go,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but to will resolutely and thoroughly; not to turn and toss, this</p>
<p class="calibre1">way and that, a maimed and half-divided will, struggling, with one</p>
<p class="calibre1">part sinking as another rose.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lastly, in the very fever of my irresoluteness, I made with my</p>
<p class="calibre1">body many such motions as men sometimes would, but cannot, if either</p>
<p class="calibre1">they have not the limbs, or these be bound with bands, weakened with</p>
<p class="calibre1">infirmity, or any other way hindered. Thus, if I tore my hair, beat my</p>
<p class="calibre1">forehead, if locking my fingers I clasped my knee; I willed, I did it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I might have willed, and not done it; if the power of motion in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">limbs had not obeyed. So many things then I did, when “to will” was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not in itself “to be able”; and I did not what both I longed</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomparably more to do, and which soon after, when I should will, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be able to do; because soon after, when I should will, I should</p>
<p class="calibre1">will thoroughly. For in these things the ability was one with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">will, and to will was to do; and yet was it not done: and more</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily did my body obey the weakest willing of my soul, in moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">its limbs at its nod, than the soul obeyed itself to accomplish in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">will alone this its momentous will.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whence is this monstrousness? and to what end? Let Thy mercy gleam</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I may ask, if so be the secret penalties of men, and those</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkest pangs of the sons of Adam, may perhaps answer me. Whence is</p>
<p class="calibre1">this monstrousness? and to what end? The mind commands the body, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it obeys instantly; the mind commands itself, and is resisted. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind commands the hand to be moved; and such readiness is there,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that command is scarce distinct from obedience. Yet the mind is</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind, the hand is body. The mind commands the mind, its own self, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">will, and yet it doth not. Whence this monstrousness? and to what end?</p>
<p class="calibre1">It commands itself, I say, to will, and would not command, unless it</p>
<p class="calibre1">willed, and what it commands is not done. But it willeth not entirely:</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore doth it not command entirely. For so far forth it</p>
<p class="calibre1">commandeth, as it willeth: and, so far forth is the thing commanded,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not done, as it willeth not. For the will commandeth that there be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">will; not another, but itself. But it doth not command entirely,</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore what it commandeth, is not. For were the will entire, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not even command it to be, because it would already be. It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore no monstrousness partly to will, partly to nill, but a</p>
<p class="calibre1">disease of the mind, that it doth not wholly rise, by truth upborne,</p>
<p class="calibre1">borne down by custom. And therefore are there two wills, for that</p>
<p class="calibre1">one of them is not entire: and what the one lacketh, the other hath.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let them perish from Thy presence, O God, as perish vain talkers and</p>
<p class="calibre1">seducers of the soul: who observing that in deliberating there were</p>
<p class="calibre1">two wills, affirm that there are two minds in us of two kinds, one</p>
<p class="calibre1">good, the other evil. Themselves are truly evil, when they hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">these evil things; and themselves shall become good when they hold the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth and assent unto the truth, that Thy Apostle may say to them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ye were sometimes darkness, but now light in the Lord. But they,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wishing to be light, not in the Lord, but in themselves, imagining the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature of the soul to be that which God is, are made more gross</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness through a dreadful arrogancy; for that they went back farther</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Thee, the true Light that enlightened every man that cometh</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the world. Take heed what you say, and blush for shame: draw near</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Myself when I was deliberating upon serving the Lord my God now, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had long purposed, it was I who willed, I who nilled, I, I myself. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither willed entirely, nor nilled entirely. Therefore was I at</p>
<p class="calibre1">strife with myself, and rent asunder by myself. And this rent befell</p>
<p class="calibre1">me against my will, and yet indicated, not the presence of another</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind, but the punishment of my own. Therefore it was no more I that</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrought it, but sin that dwelt in me; the punishment of a sin more</p>
<p class="calibre1">freely committed, in that I was a son of Adam.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For if there he so many contrary natures as there be conflicting</p>
<p class="calibre1">wills, there shall now be not two only, but many. If a man</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberate whether he should go to their conventicle or to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">theatre, these Manichees cry out, Behold, here are two natures: one</p>
<p class="calibre1">good, draws this way; another bad, draws back that way. For whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">else is this hesitation between conflicting wills? But I say that both</p>
<p class="calibre1">be bad: that which draws to them, as that which draws back to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">theatre. But they believe not that will to be other than good, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">draws to them. What then if one of us should deliberate, and amid</p>
<p class="calibre1">the strife of his two wills be in a strait, whether he should go to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the theatre or to our church? would not these Manichees also be in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strait what to answer? For either they must confess (which they fain</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not) that the will which leads to our church is good, as well as</p>
<p class="calibre1">theirs, who have received and are held by the mysteries of theirs:</p>
<p class="calibre1">or they must suppose two evil natures, and two evil souls</p>
<p class="calibre1">conflicting in one man, and it will not be true, which they say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that there is one good and another bad; or they must be converted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the truth, and no more deny that where one deliberates, one soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">fluctuates between contrary wills.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let them no more say then, when they perceive two conflicting</p>
<p class="calibre1">wills in one man, that the conflict is between two contrary souls,</p>
<p class="calibre1">of two contrary substances, from two contrary principles, one good,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the other bad. For Thou, O true God, dost disprove, check, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">convict them; as when, both wills being bad, one deliberates whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">he should kill a man by poison or by the sword; whether he should</p>
<p class="calibre1">seize this or that estate of another’s, when he cannot both; whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">he should purchase pleasure by luxury, or keep his money by</p>
<p class="calibre1">covetousness; whether he go to the circus or the theatre, if both be</p>
<p class="calibre1">open on one day; or thirdly, to rob another’s house, if he have the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity; or, fourthly, to commit adultery, if at the same time</p>
<p class="calibre1">he have the means thereof also; all these meeting together in the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">juncture of time, and all being equally desired, which cannot at one</p>
<p class="calibre1">time be acted: for they rend the mind amid four, or even (amid the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vast variety of things desired) more, conflicting wills, nor do they</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet allege that there are so many divers substances. So also in</p>
<p class="calibre1">wills which are good. For I ask them, is it good to take pleasure in</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading the Apostle? or good to take pleasure in a sober Psalm? or</p>
<p class="calibre1">good to discourse on the Gospel? They will answer to each, “it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">good.” What then if all give equal pleasure, and all at once? Do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">divers wills distract the mind, while he deliberates which he should</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather choose? yet are they all good, and are at variance till one</p>
<p class="calibre1">be chosen, whither the one entire will may be borne, which before</p>
<p class="calibre1">was divided into many. Thus also, when, above, eternity delights us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the pleasure of temporal good holds us down below, it is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same soul which willeth not this or that with an entire will; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore is rent asunder with grievous perplexities, while out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth it sets this first, but out of habit sets not that aside.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus soul-sick was I, and tormented, accusing myself much more</p>
<p class="calibre1">severely than my wont, rolling and turning me in my chain, till that</p>
<p class="calibre1">were wholly broken, whereby I now was but just, but still was, held.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And Thou, O Lord, pressedst upon me in my inward parts by a severe</p>
<p class="calibre1">mercy, redoubling the lashes of fear and shame, lest I should again</p>
<p class="calibre1">give way, and not bursting that same slight remaining tie, it should</p>
<p class="calibre1">recover strength, and bind me the faster. For I said with myself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be it done now, be it done now.” And as I spake, I all but enacted</p>
<p class="calibre1">it: I all but did it, and did it not: yet sunk not back to my former</p>
<p class="calibre1">state, but kept my stand hard by, and took breath. And I essayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, and wanted somewhat less of it, and somewhat less, and all</p>
<p class="calibre1">but touched, and laid hold of it; and yet came not at it, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">touched nor laid hold of it; hesitating to die to death and to live to</p>
<p class="calibre1">life: and the worse whereto I was inured, prevailed more with me</p>
<p class="calibre1">than the better whereto I was unused: and the very moment wherein I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was to become other than I was, the nearer it approached me, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater horror did it strike into me; yet did it not strike me back,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor turned me away, but held me in suspense.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The very toys of toys, and vanities of vanities, my ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistresses, still held me; they plucked my fleshy garment, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered softly, “Dost thou cast us off? and from that moment shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">we no more be with thee for ever? and from that moment shall not</p>
<p class="calibre1">this or that be lawful for thee for ever?” And what was it which</p>
<p class="calibre1">they suggested in that I said, “this or that,” what did they</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggest, O my God? Let Thy mercy turn it away from the soul of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servant. What defilements did they suggest! what shame! And now I much</p>
<p class="calibre1">less than half heard them, and not openly showing themselves and</p>
<p class="calibre1">contradicting me, but muttering as it were behind my back, and privily</p>
<p class="calibre1">plucking me, as I was departing, but to look back on them. Yet they</p>
<p class="calibre1">did retard me, so that I hesitated to burst and shake myself free from</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, and to spring over whither I was called; a violent habit</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying to me, “Thinkest thou, thou canst live without them?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now it spake very faintly. For on that side whither I had set my</p>
<p class="calibre1">face, and whither I trembled to go, there appeared unto me the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chaste dignity of Continency, serene, yet not relaxedly, gay, honestly</p>
<p class="calibre1">alluring me to come and doubt not; and stretching forth to receive and</p>
<p class="calibre1">embrace me, her holy hands full of multitudes of good examples:</p>
<p class="calibre1">there were so many young men and maidens here, a multitude of youth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and every age, grave widows and aged virgins; and Continence herself</p>
<p class="calibre1">in all, not barren, but a fruitful mother of children of joys, by Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">her Husband, O Lord. And she smiled on me with a persuasive mockery,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as would she say, “Canst not thou what these youths, what these</p>
<p class="calibre1">maidens can? or can they either in themselves, and not rather in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord their God? The Lord their God gave me unto them. Why standest</p>
<p class="calibre1">thou in thyself, and so standest not? cast thyself upon Him, fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">not He will not withdraw Himself that thou shouldest fall; cast</p>
<p class="calibre1">thyself fearlessly upon Him, He will receive, and will heal thee.” And</p>
<p class="calibre1">I blushed exceedingly, for that I yet heard the muttering of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">toys, and hung in suspense. And she again seemed to say, “Stop thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears against those thy unclean members on the earth, that they may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be mortified. They tell thee of delights, but not as doth the law of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Lord thy God.” This controversy in my heart was self against</p>
<p class="calibre1">self only. But Alypius sitting close by my side, in silence waited the</p>
<p class="calibre1">issue of my unwonted emotion.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when a deep consideration had from the secret bottom of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul drawn together and heaped up all my misery in the sight of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart; there arose a mighty storm, bringing a mighty shower of</p>
<p class="calibre1">tears. Which that I might pour forth wholly, in its natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">expressions, I rose from Alypius: solitude was suggested to me as</p>
<p class="calibre1">fitter for the business of weeping; so I retired so far that even</p>
<p class="calibre1">his presence could not be a burden to me. Thus was it then with me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and he perceived something of it; for something I suppose I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoken, wherein the tones of my voice appeared choked with weeping,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and so had risen up. He then remained where we were sitting, most</p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely astonished. I cast myself down I know not how, under a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain fig-tree, giving full vent to my tears; and the floods of mine</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes gushed out an acceptable sacrifice to Thee. And, not indeed in</p>
<p class="calibre1">these words, yet to this purpose, spake I much unto Thee: and Thou,</p>
<p class="calibre1">O Lord, how long? how long, Lord, wilt Thou be angry for ever?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember not our former iniquities, for I felt that I was held by</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. I sent up these sorrowful words: How long, how long, “tomorrow,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and tomorrow?” Why not now? why not is there this hour an end to my</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncleanness?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">So was I speaking and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, when, lo! I heard from a neighbouring house a voice, as of</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy or girl, I know not, chanting, and oft repeating, “Take up and</p>
<p class="calibre1">read; Take up and read. ” Instantly, my countenance altered, I began</p>
<p class="calibre1">to think most intently whether children were wont in any kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">play to sing such words: nor could I remember ever to have heard the</p>
<p class="calibre1">like. So checking the torrent of my tears, I arose; interpreting it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be no other than a command from God to open the book, and read the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first chapter I should find. For I had heard of Antony, that coming in</p>
<p class="calibre1">during the reading of the Gospel, he received the admonition, as if</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was being read was spoken to him: Go, sell all that thou hast,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come</p>
<p class="calibre1">and follow me: and by such oracle he was forthwith converted unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. Eagerly then I returned to the place where Alypius was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting; for there had I laid the volume of the Apostle when I arose</p>
<p class="calibre1">thence. I seized, opened, and in silence read that section on which my</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes first fell: Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, in concupiscence. No</p>
<p class="calibre1">further would I read; nor needed I: for instantly at the end of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">sentence, by a light as it were of serenity infused into my heart, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the darkness of doubt vanished away.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then putting my finger between, or some other mark, I shut the</p>
<p class="calibre1">volume, and with a calmed countenance made it known to Alypius. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was wrought in him, which I knew not, he thus showed me. He asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">to see what I had read: I showed him; and he looked even further</p>
<p class="calibre1">than I had read, and I knew not what followed. This followed, him that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is weak in the faith, receive; which he applied to himself, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">disclosed to me. And by this admonition was he strengthened; and by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a good resolution and purpose, and most corresponding to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">character, wherein he did always very far differ from me, for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">better, without any turbulent delay he joined me. Thence we go in to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my mother; we tell her; she rejoiceth: we relate in order how it</p>
<p class="calibre1">took place; she leaps for joy, and triumpheth, and blesseth Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Who are able to do above that which we ask or think; for she perceived</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Thou hadst given her more for me, than she was wont to beg by her</p>
<p class="calibre1">pitiful and most sorrowful groanings. For thou convertedst me unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyself, so that I sought neither wife, nor any hope of this world,</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing in that rule of faith, where Thou hadst showed me unto her in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a vision, so many years before. And Thou didst convert her mourning</p>
<p class="calibre1">into joy, much more plentiful than she had desired, and in a much more</p>
<p class="calibre1">precious and purer way than she erst required, by having grandchildren</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my body.</p>
