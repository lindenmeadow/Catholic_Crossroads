<h2 id="calibre_toc_4" class="calibre7">BOOK III</h2><p class="calibre1">To Carthage I came, where there sang all around me in my ears a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cauldron of unholy loves. I loved not yet, yet I loved to love, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of a deep-seated want, I hated myself for wanting not. I sought</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I might love, in love with loving, and safety I hated, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">way without snares. For within me was a famine of that inward food,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyself, my God; yet, through that famine I was not hungered; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">was without all longing for incorruptible sustenance, not because</p>
<p class="calibre1">filled therewith, but the more empty, the more I loathed it. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">this cause my soul was sickly and full of sores, it miserably cast</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself forth, desiring to be scraped by the touch of objects of sense.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet if these had not a soul, they would not be objects of love. To</p>
<p class="calibre1">love then, and to be beloved, was sweet to me; but more, when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained to enjoy the person I loved, I defiled, therefore, the spring</p>
<p class="calibre1">of friendship with the filth of concupiscence, and I beclouded its</p>
<p class="calibre1">brightness with the hell of lustfulness; and thus foul and unseemly, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would fain, through exceeding vanity, be fine and courtly. I fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">headlong then into the love wherein I longed to be ensnared. My God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">my Mercy, with how much gall didst Thou out of Thy great goodness</p>
<p class="calibre1">besprinkle for me that sweetness? For I was both beloved, and secretly</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived at the bond of enjoying; and was with joy fettered with</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorrow-bringing bonds, that I might be scourged with the iron</p>
<p class="calibre1">burning rods of jealousy, and suspicions, and fears, and angers, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarrels.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stage-plays also carried me away, full of images of my miseries, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">of fuel to my fire. Why is it, that man desires to be made sad,</p>
<p class="calibre1">beholding doleful and tragical things, which yet himself would no</p>
<p class="calibre1">means suffer? yet he desires as a spectator to feel sorrow at them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">this very sorrow is his pleasure. What is this but a miserable</p>
<p class="calibre1">madness? for a man is the more affected with these actions, the less</p>
<p class="calibre1">free he is from such affections. Howsoever, when he suffers in his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">person, it uses to be styled misery: when he compassionates others,</p>
<p class="calibre1">then it is mercy. But what sort of compassion is this for feigned</p>
<p class="calibre1">and scenical passions? for the auditor is not called on to relieve,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but only to grieve: and he applauds the actor of these fictions the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more, the more he grieves. And if the calamities of those persons</p>
<p class="calibre1">(whether of old times, or mere fiction) be so acted, that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spectator is not moved to tears, he goes away disgusted and</p>
<p class="calibre1">criticising; but if he be moved to passion, he stays intent, and weeps</p>
<p class="calibre1">for joy.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are griefs then too loved? Verily all desire joy. Or whereas no</p>
<p class="calibre1">man likes to be miserable, is he yet pleased to be merciful? which</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it cannot be without passion, for this reason alone are</p>
<p class="calibre1">passions loved? This also springs from that vein of friendship. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">whither goes that vein? whither flows it? wherefore runs it into</p>
<p class="calibre1">that torrent of pitch bubbling forth those monstrous tides of foul</p>
<p class="calibre1">lustfulness, into which it is wilfully changed and transformed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">being of its own will precipitated and corrupted from its heavenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">clearness? Shall compassion then be put away? by no means. Be griefs</p>
<p class="calibre1">then sometimes loved. But beware of uncleanness, O my soul, under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the guardianship of my God, the God of our fathers, who is to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">praised and exalted above all for ever, beware of uncleanness. For I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have not now ceased to pity; but then in the theatres I rejoiced</p>
<p class="calibre1">with lovers when they wickedly enjoyed one another, although this</p>
<p class="calibre1">was imaginary only in the play. And when they lost one another, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if very compassionate, I sorrowed with them, yet had my delight in</p>
<p class="calibre1">both. But now I much more pity him that rejoiceth in his wickedness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">than him who is thought to suffer hardship, by missing some pernicious</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure, and the loss of some miserable felicity. This certainly is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the truer mercy, but in it grief delights not. For though he that</p>
<p class="calibre1">grieves for the miserable, be commended for his office of charity; yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">had he, who is genuinely compassionate, rather there were nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">for him to grieve for. For if good will be ill willed (which can never</p>
<p class="calibre1">be), then may he, who truly and sincerely commiserates, wish there</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be some miserable, that he might commiserate. Some sorrow may</p>
<p class="calibre1">then be allowed, none loved. For thus dost Thou, O Lord God, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">lovest souls far more purely than we, and hast more incorruptibly pity</p>
<p class="calibre1">on them, yet are wounded with no sorrowfulness. And who is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficient for these things?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I, miserable, then loved to grieve, and sought out what to</p>
<p class="calibre1">grieve at, when in another’s and that feigned and personated misery,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that acting best pleased me, and attracted me the most vehemently,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which drew tears from me. What marvel that an unhappy sheep,</p>
<p class="calibre1">straying from Thy flock, and impatient of Thy keeping, I became</p>
<p class="calibre1">infected with a foul disease? And hence the love of griefs; not such</p>
<p class="calibre1">as should sink deep into me; for I loved not to suffer, what I loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">to look on; but such as upon hearing their fictions should lightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">scratch the surface; upon which, as on envenomed nails, followed</p>
<p class="calibre1">inflamed swelling, impostumes, and a putrefied sore. My life being</p>
<p class="calibre1">such, was it life, O my God?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Thy faithful mercy hovered over me afar. Upon how grievous</p>
<p class="calibre1">iniquities consumed I myself, pursuing a sacrilegious curiosity,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that having forsaken Thee, it might bring me to the treacherous abyss,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the beguiling service of devils, to whom I sacrificed my evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions, and in all these things Thou didst scourge me! I dared</p>
<p class="calibre1">even, while Thy solemnities were celebrated within the walls of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church, to desire, and to compass a business deserving death for its</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruits, for which Thou scourgedst me with grievous punishments, though</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing to my fault, O Thou my exceeding mercy, my God, my refuge from</p>
<p class="calibre1">those terrible destroyers, among whom I wandered with a stiff neck,</p>
<p class="calibre1">withdrawing further from Thee, loving mine own ways, and not Thine;</p>
<p class="calibre1">loving a vagrant liberty.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those studies also, which were accounted commendable, had a view</p>
<p class="calibre1">to excelling in the courts of litigation; the more bepraised, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">craftier. Such is men’s blindness, glorying even in their blindness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And now I was chief in the rhetoric school, whereat I joyed proudly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I swelled with arrogancy, though (Lord, Thou knowest) far</p>
<p class="calibre1">quieter and altogether removed from the subvertings of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Subverters” (for this ill-omened and devilish name was the very badge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of gallantry) among whom I lived, with a shameless shame that I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not even as they. With them I lived, and was sometimes delighted</p>
<p class="calibre1">with their friendship, whose doings I ever did abhor -i.e., their</p>
<p class="calibre1">“subvertings,” wherewith they wantonly persecuted the modesty of</p>
<p class="calibre1">strangers, which they disturbed by a gratuitous jeering, feeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereon their malicious birth. Nothing can be liker the very actions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of devils than these. What then could they be more truly called than</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Subverters”? themselves subverted and altogether perverted first, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceiving spirits secretly deriding and seducing them, wherein</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves delight to jeer at and deceive others.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among such as these, in that unsettled age of mine, learned I</p>
<p class="calibre1">books of eloquence, wherein I desired to be eminent, out of a damnable</p>
<p class="calibre1">and vainglorious end, a joy in human vanity. In the ordinary course of</p>
<p class="calibre1">study, I fell upon a certain book of Cicero, whose speech almost all</p>
<p class="calibre1">admire, not so his heart. This book of his contains an exhortation</p>
<p class="calibre1">to philosophy, and is called “Hortensius.” But this book altered my</p>
<p class="calibre1">affections, and turned my prayers to Thyself O Lord; and made me</p>
<p class="calibre1">have other purposes and desires. Every vain hope at once became</p>
<p class="calibre1">worthless to me; and I longed with an incredibly burning desire for an</p>
<p class="calibre1">immortality of wisdom, and began now to arise, that I might return</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thee. For not to sharpen my tongue (which thing I seemed to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchasing with my mother’s allowances, in that my nineteenth year, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father being dead two years before), not to sharpen my tongue did I</p>
<p class="calibre1">employ that book; nor did it infuse into me its style, but its matter.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did I burn then, my God, how did I burn to re-mount from earthly</p>
<p class="calibre1">things to Thee, nor knew I what Thou wouldest do with me? For with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee is wisdom. But the love of wisdom is in Greek called</p>
<p class="calibre1">“philosophy,” with which that book inflamed me. Some there be that</p>
<p class="calibre1">seduce through philosophy, under a great, and smooth, and honourable</p>
<p class="calibre1">name colouring and disguising their own errors: and almost all who</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that and former ages were such, are in that book censured and set</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth: there also is made plain that wholesome advice of Thy Spirit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Thy good and devout servant: Beware lest any man spoil you</p>
<p class="calibre1">through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,</p>
<p class="calibre1">after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And since at that time</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Thou, O light of my heart, knowest) Apostolic Scripture was not known</p>
<p class="calibre1">to me, I was delighted with that exhortation, so far only, that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was thereby strongly roused, and kindled, and inflamed to love, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">seek, and obtain, and hold, and embrace not this or that sect, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom itself whatever it were; and this alone checked me thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">unkindled, that the name of Christ was not in it. For this name,</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to Thy mercy, O Lord, this name of my Saviour Thy Son, had</p>
<p class="calibre1">my tender heart, even with my mother’s milk, devoutly drunk in and</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeply treasured; and whatsoever was without that name, though never</p>
<p class="calibre1">so learned, polished, or true, took not entire hold of me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I resolved then to bend my mind to the holy Scriptures, that I might</p>
<p class="calibre1">see what they were. But behold, I see a thing not understood by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">proud, nor laid open to children, lowly in access, in its recesses</p>
<p class="calibre1">lofty, and veiled with mysteries; and I was not such as could enter</p>
<p class="calibre1">into it, or stoop my neck to follow its steps. For not as I now speak,</p>
<p class="calibre1">did I feel when I turned to those Scriptures; but they seemed to me</p>
<p class="calibre1">unworthy to he compared to the stateliness of Tully: for my swelling</p>
<p class="calibre1">pride shrunk from their lowliness, nor could my sharp wit pierce the</p>
<p class="calibre1">interior thereof. Yet were they such as would grow up in a little one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I disdained to be a little one; and, swollen with pride, took</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself to be a great one.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore I fell among men proudly doting, exceeding carnal and</p>
<p class="calibre1">prating, in whose mouths were the snares of the Devil, limed with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mixture of the syllables of Thy name, and of our Lord Jesus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ, and of the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, our Comforter. These</p>
<p class="calibre1">names departed not out of their mouth, but so far forth as the sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">only and the noise of the tongue, for the heart was void of truth. Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">they cried out “Truth, Truth,” and spake much thereof to me, yet it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not in them: but they spake falsehood, not of Thee only (who truly</p>
<p class="calibre1">art Truth), but even of those elements of this world, Thy creatures.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I indeed ought to have passed by even philosophers who spake truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerning them, for love of Thee, my Father, supremely good, Beauty</p>
<p class="calibre1">of all things beautiful. O Truth, Truth, how inwardly did even then</p>
<p class="calibre1">the marrow of my soul pant after Thee, when they often and</p>
<p class="calibre1">diversely, and in many and huge books, echoed of Thee to me, though it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was but an echo? And these were the dishes wherein to me, hungering</p>
<p class="calibre1">after Thee, they, instead of Thee, served up the Sun and Moon,</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful works of Thine, but yet Thy works, not Thyself, no nor Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">first works. For Thy spiritual works are before these corporeal works,</p>
<p class="calibre1">celestial though they be, and shining. But I hungered and thirsted not</p>
<p class="calibre1">even after those first works of Thine, but after Thee Thyself, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Truth, in whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning: yet they</p>
<p class="calibre1">still set before me in those dishes, glittering fantasies, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">which better were it to love this very sun (which is real to our sight</p>
<p class="calibre1">at least), than those fantasies which by our eyes deceive our mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet because I thought them to be Thee, I fed thereon; not eagerly, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou didst not in them taste to me as Thou art; for Thou wast not</p>
<p class="calibre1">these emptinesses, nor was I nourished by them, but exhausted</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather. Food in sleep shows very like our food awake; yet are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">those asleep nourished by it, for they are asleep. But those were</p>
<p class="calibre1">not even any way like to Thee, as Thou hast now spoken to me; for</p>
<p class="calibre1">those were corporeal fantasies, false bodies, than which these true</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies, celestial or terrestrial, which with our fleshly sight we</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold, are far more certain: these things the beasts and birds</p>
<p class="calibre1">discern as well as we, and they are more certain than when we fancy</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. And again, we do with more certainty fancy them, than by them</p>
<p class="calibre1">conjecture other vaster and infinite bodies which have no being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such empty husks was I then fed on; and was not fed. But Thou, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul’s Love, in looking for whom I fail, that I may become strong, art</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither those bodies which we see, though in heaven; nor those which</p>
<p class="calibre1">we see not there; for Thou hast created them, nor dost Thou account</p>
<p class="calibre1">them among the chiefest of Thy works. How far then art Thou from those</p>
<p class="calibre1">fantasies of mine, fantasies of bodies which altogether are not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">than which the images of those bodies, which are, are far more</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain, and more certain still the bodies themselves, which yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou art not; no, nor yet the soul, which is the life of the bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So then, better and more certain is the life of the bodies than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies. But Thou art the life of souls, the life of lives, having life</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thyself; and changest not, life of my soul.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where then wert Thou then to me, and how far from me? Far verily was</p>
<p class="calibre1">I straying from Thee, barred from the very husks of the swine, whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">with husks I fed. For how much better are the fables of poets and</p>
<p class="calibre1">grammarians than these snares? For verses, and poems, and “Medea</p>
<p class="calibre1">flying,” are more profitable truly than these men’s five elements,</p>
<p class="calibre1">variously disguised, answering to five dens of darkness, which have no</p>
<p class="calibre1">being, yet slay the believer. For verses and poems I can turn to</p>
<p class="calibre1">true food, and “Medea flying,” though I did sing, I maintained not;</p>
<p class="calibre1">though I heard it sung, I believed not: but those things I did</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe. Woe, woe, by what steps was I brought down to the depths of</p>
<p class="calibre1">hell! toiling and turmoiling through want of Truth, since I sought</p>
<p class="calibre1">after Thee, my God (to Thee I confess it, who hadst mercy on me, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">as yet confessing), not according to the understanding of the mind,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherein Thou willedst that I should excel the beasts, but according to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sense of the flesh. But Thou wert more inward to me than my most</p>
<p class="calibre1">inward part; and higher than my highest. I lighted upon that bold</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman, simple and knoweth nothing, shadowed out in Solomon, sitting at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the door, and saying, Eat ye bread of secrecies willingly, and drink</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye stolen waters which are sweet: she seduced me, because she found my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul dwelling abroad in the eye of my flesh, and ruminating on such</p>
<p class="calibre1">food as through it I had devoured.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For other than this, that which really is I knew not; and was, as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were through sharpness of wit, persuaded to assent to foolish</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceivers, when they asked me, “whence is evil?” “is God bounded by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a bodily shape, and has hairs and nails?” “are they to be esteemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">righteous who had many wives at once, and did kill men, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrifice living creatures?” At which I, in my ignorance, was much</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubled, and departing from the truth, seemed to myself to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">making towards it; because as yet I knew not that evil was nothing but</p>
<p class="calibre1">a privation of good, until at last a thing ceases altogether to be;</p>
<p class="calibre1">which how should I see, the sight of whose eyes reached only to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies, and of my mind to a phantasm? And I knew not God to be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit, not one who hath parts extended in length and breadth, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose being was bulk; for every bulk is less in a part than in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole: and if it be infinite, it must be less in such part as is</p>
<p class="calibre1">defined by a certain space, than in its infinitude; and so is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">wholly every where, as Spirit, as God. And what that should be in</p>
<p class="calibre1">us, by which we were like to God, and might be rightly said to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">after the image of God, I was altogether ignorant.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor knew I that true inward righteousness which judgeth not</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to custom, but out of the most rightful law of God Almighty,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby the ways of places and times were disposed according to</p>
<p class="calibre1">those times and places; itself meantime being the same always and</p>
<p class="calibre1">every where, not one thing in one place, and another in another;</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to which Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">David, were righteous, and all those commended by the mouth of God;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but were judged unrighteous by silly men, judging out of man’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">judgment, and measuring by their own petty habits, the moral habits of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the whole human race. As if in an armory, one ignorant of what were</p>
<p class="calibre1">adapted to each part should cover his head with greaves, or seek to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">shod with a helmet, and complain that they fitted not: or as if on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">day when business is publicly stopped in the afternoon, one were</p>
<p class="calibre1">angered at not being allowed to keep open shop, because he had been in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the forenoon; or when in one house he observeth some servant take a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing in his hand, which the butler is not suffered to meddle with; or</p>
<p class="calibre1">something permitted out of doors, which is forbidden in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dining-room; and should be angry, that in one house, and one family,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same thing is not allotted every where, and to all. Even such</p>
<p class="calibre1">are they who are fretted to hear something to have been lawful for</p>
<p class="calibre1">righteous men formerly, which now is not; or that God, for certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">temporal respects, commanded them one thing, and these another,</p>
<p class="calibre1">obeying both the same righteousness: whereas they see, in one man, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">one day, and one house, different things to be fit for different</p>
<p class="calibre1">members, and a thing formerly lawful, after a certain time not so;</p>
<p class="calibre1">in one corner permitted or commanded, but in another rightly forbidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">and punished. Is justice therefore various or mutable? No, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">times, over which it presides, flow not evenly, because they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">times. But men whose days are few upon the earth, for that by their</p>
<p class="calibre1">senses they cannot harmonise the causes of things in former ages and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other nations, which they had not experience of, with these which they</p>
<p class="calibre1">have experience of, whereas in one and the same body, day, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">family, they easily see what is fitting for each member, and season,</p>
<p class="calibre1">part, and person; to the one they take exceptions, to the other they</p>
<p class="calibre1">submit.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">These things I then knew not, nor observed; they struck my sight</p>
<p class="calibre1">on all sides, and I saw them not. I indited verses, in which I might</p>
<p class="calibre1">not place every foot every where, but differently in different metres;</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor even in any one metre the self-same foot in all places. Yet the</p>
<p class="calibre1">art itself, by which I indited, had not different principles for these</p>
<p class="calibre1">different cases, but comprised all in one. Still I saw not how that</p>
<p class="calibre1">righteousness, which good and holy men obeyed, did far more</p>
<p class="calibre1">excellently and sublimely contain in one all those things which God</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanded, and in no part varied; although in varying times it</p>
<p class="calibre1">prescribed not every thing at once, but apportioned and enjoined</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was fit for each. And I in my blindness, censured the holy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fathers, not only wherein they made use of things present as God</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanded and inspired them, but also wherein they were foretelling</p>
<p class="calibre1">things to come, as God was revealing in them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can it at any time or place be unjust to love God with all his</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, with all his soul, and with all his mind; and his neighbour</p>
<p class="calibre1">as himself? Therefore are those foul offences which be against nature,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be every where and at all times detested and punished; such as were</p>
<p class="calibre1">those of the men of Sodom: which should all nations commit, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">should all stand guilty of the same crime, by the law of God, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath not so made men that they should so abuse one another. For even</p>
<p class="calibre1">that intercourse which should be between God and us is violated,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when that same nature, of which He is Author, is polluted by</p>
<p class="calibre1">perversity of lust. But those actions which are offences against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">customs of men, are to be avoided according to the customs severally</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevailing; so that a thing agreed upon, and confirmed, by custom or</p>
<p class="calibre1">law of any city or nation, may not be violated at the lawless pleasure</p>
<p class="calibre1">of any, whether native or foreigner. For any part which harmoniseth</p>
<p class="calibre1">not with its whole, is offensive. But when God commands a thing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be done, against the customs or compact of any people, though it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were never by them done heretofore, it is to be done; and if</p>
<p class="calibre1">intermitted, it is to be restored; and if never ordained, is now to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordained. For lawful if it he for a king, in the state which he reigns</p>
<p class="calibre1">over, to command that which no one before him, nor he himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">heretofore, had commanded, and to obey him cannot be against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">common weal of the state (nay, it were against it if he were not</p>
<p class="calibre1">obeyed, for to obey princes is a general compact of human society);</p>
<p class="calibre1">how much more unhesitatingly ought we to obey God, in all which He</p>
<p class="calibre1">commands, the Ruler of all His creatures! For as among the powers in</p>
<p class="calibre1">man’s society, the greater authority is obeyed in preference to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lesser, so must God above all.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">So in acts of violence, where there is a wish to hurt, whether by</p>
<p class="calibre1">reproach or injury; and these either for revenge, as one enemy against</p>
<p class="calibre1">another; or for some profit belonging to another, as the robber to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">traveller; or to avoid some evil, as towards one who is feared; or</p>
<p class="calibre1">through envy, as one less fortunate to one more so, or one well</p>
<p class="calibre1">thriven in any thing, to him whose being on a par with himself he</p>
<p class="calibre1">fears, or grieves at, or for the mere pleasure at another’s pain, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">spectators of gladiators, or deriders and mockers of others. These</p>
<p class="calibre1">be the heads of iniquity which spring from the lust of the flesh, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the eye, or of rule, either singly, or two combined, or all</p>
<p class="calibre1">together; and so do men live ill against the three, and seven, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">psaltery of often strings, Thy Ten Commandments, O God, most high, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">most sweet. But what foul offences can there be against Thee, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">canst not be defiled? or what acts of violence against Thee, who canst</p>
<p class="calibre1">not be harmed? But Thou avengest what men commit against themselves,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing also when they sin against Thee, they do wickedly against their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own souls, and iniquity gives itself the lie, by corrupting and</p>
<p class="calibre1">perverting their nature, which Thou hast created and ordained, or by</p>
<p class="calibre1">an immoderate use of things allowed, or in burning in things</p>
<p class="calibre1">unallowed, to that use which is against nature; or are found guilty,</p>
<p class="calibre1">raging with heart and tongue against Thee, kicking against the pricks;</p>
<p class="calibre1">or when, bursting the pale of human society, they boldly joy in</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-willed combinations or divisions, according as they have any</p>
<p class="calibre1">object to gain or subject of offence. And these things are done when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou art forsaken, O Fountain of Life, who art the only and true</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creator and Governor of the Universe, and by a self-willed pride,</p>
<p class="calibre1">any one false thing is selected therefrom and loved. So then by a</p>
<p class="calibre1">humble devoutness we return to Thee; and Thou cleansest us from our</p>
<p class="calibre1">evil habits, and art merciful to their sins who confess, and hearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">the groaning of the prisoner, and loosest us from the chains which</p>
<p class="calibre1">we made for ourselves, if we lift not up against Thee the horns of</p>
<p class="calibre1">an unreal liberty, suffering the loss of all, through covetousness</p>
<p class="calibre1">of more, by loving more our own private good than Thee, the Good of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amidst these offences of foulness and violence, and so many</p>
<p class="calibre1">iniquities, are sins of men, who are on the whole making</p>
<p class="calibre1">proficiency; which by those that judge rightly, are, after the rule of</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfection, discommended, yet the persons commended, upon hope of</p>
<p class="calibre1">future fruit, as in the green blade of growing corn. And there are</p>
<p class="calibre1">some, resembling offences of foulness or violence, which yet are no</p>
<p class="calibre1">sins; because they offend neither Thee, our Lord God, nor human</p>
<p class="calibre1">society; when, namely, things fitting for a given period are</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained for the service of life, and we know not whether out of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lust of having; or when things are, for the sake of correction, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">constituted authority punished, and we know not whether out of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lust of hurting. Many an action then which in men’s sight is</p>
<p class="calibre1">disapproved, is by Thy testimony approved; and many, by men praised,</p>
<p class="calibre1">are (Thou being witness) condemned: because the show of the action,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the mind of the doer, and the unknown exigency of the period,</p>
<p class="calibre1">severally vary. But when Thou on a sudden commandest an unwonted and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unthought of thing, yea, although Thou hast sometime forbidden it, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">still for the time hidest the reason of Thy command, and it be against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ordinance of some society of men, who doubts but it is to be done,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing that society of men is just which serves Thee? But blessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">are they who know Thy commands! For all things were done by Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servants; either to show forth something needful for the present, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">to foreshow things to come.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">These things I being ignorant of, scoffed at those Thy holy servants</p>
<p class="calibre1">and prophets. And what gained I by scoffing at them, but to be scoffed</p>
<p class="calibre1">at by Thee, being insensibly and step by step drawn on to those</p>
<p class="calibre1">follies, as to believe that a fig-tree wept when it was plucked, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the tree, its mother, shed milky tears? Which fig notwithstanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">(plucked by some other’s, not his own, guilt) had some Manichaean</p>
<p class="calibre1">saint eaten, and mingled with his bowels, he should breathe out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it angels, yea, there shall burst forth particles of divinity, at</p>
<p class="calibre1">every moan or groan in his prayer, which particles of the most high</p>
<p class="calibre1">and true God had remained bound in that fig, unless they had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">set at liberty by the teeth or belly of some “Elect” saint! And I,</p>
<p class="calibre1">miserable, believed that more mercy was to be shown to the fruits of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the earth than men, for whom they were created. For if any one an</p>
<p class="calibre1">hungered, not a Manichaean, should ask for any, that morsel would seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">as it were condemned to capital punishment, which should be given him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Thou sentest Thine hand from above, and drewest my soul out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that profound darkness, my mother, Thy faithful one, weeping to Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">for me, more than mothers weep the bodily deaths of their children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For she, by that faith and spirit which she had from Thee, discerned</p>
<p class="calibre1">the death wherein I lay, and Thou heardest her, O Lord; Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">heardest her, and despisedst not her tears, when streaming down,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they watered the ground under her eyes in every place where she</p>
<p class="calibre1">prayed; yea Thou heardest her. For whence was that dream whereby</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou comfortedst her; so that she allowed me to live with her, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">to eat at the same table in the house, which she had begun to shrink</p>
<p class="calibre1">from, abhorring and detesting the blasphemies of my error? For she saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself standing on a certain wooden rule, and a shining youth</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming towards her, cheerful and smiling upon her, herself grieving,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and overwhelmed with grief. But he having (in order to instruct, as is</p>
<p class="calibre1">their wont not to be instructed) enquired of her the causes of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">grief and daily tears, and she answering that she was bewailing my</p>
<p class="calibre1">perdition, he bade her rest contented, and told her to look and</p>
<p class="calibre1">observe, “That where she was, there was I also.” And when she</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked, she saw me standing by her in the same rule. Whence was</p>
<p class="calibre1">this, but that Thine ears were towards her heart? O Thou Good</p>
<p class="calibre1">omnipotent, who so carest for every one of us, as if Thou caredst</p>
<p class="calibre1">for him only; and so for all, as if they were but one!</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whence was this also, that when she had told me this vision, and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would fain bend it to mean, “That she rather should not despair of</p>
<p class="calibre1">being one day what I was”; she presently, without any hesitation,</p>
<p class="calibre1">replies: “No; for it was not told me that, ‘where he, there thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">also’; but ‘where thou, there he also’?” I confess to Thee, O Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that to the best of my remembrance (and I have oft spoken of this),</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Thy answer, through my waking mother, -that she was not perplexed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the plausibility of my false interpretation, and so quickly saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was to be seen, and which I certainly had not perceived before</p>
<p class="calibre1">she spake, -even then moved me more than the dream itself, by which</p>
<p class="calibre1">a joy to the holy woman, to be fulfilled so long after, was, for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">consolation of her present anguish, so long before foresignified.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For almost nine years passed, in which I wallowed in the mire of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that deep pit, and the darkness of falsehood, often assaying to</p>
<p class="calibre1">rise, but dashed down the more grievously. All which time that chaste,</p>
<p class="calibre1">godly, and sober widow (such as Thou lovest), now more cheered with</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope, yet no whit relaxing in her weeping and mourning, ceased not</p>
<p class="calibre1">at all hours of her devotions to bewail my case unto Thee. And her</p>
<p class="calibre1">prayers entered into Thy presence; and yet Thou sufferedst me to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet involved and reinvolved in that darkness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou gavest her meantime another answer, which I call to mind; for</p>
<p class="calibre1">much I pass by, hasting to those things which more press me to confess</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thee, and much I do not remember. Thou gavest her then another</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer, by a Priest of Thine, a certain Bishop brought up in Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church, and well studied in Thy books. Whom when this woman had</p>
<p class="calibre1">entreated to vouchsafe to converse with me, refute my errors,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unteach me ill things, and teach me good things (for this he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">wont to do, when he found persons fitted to receive it), he refused,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisely, as I afterwards perceived. For he answered, that I was yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">unteachable, being puffed up with the novelty of that heresy, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had already perplexed divers unskilful persons with captious</p>
<p class="calibre1">questions, as she had told him: “but let him alone a while” (saith</p>
<p class="calibre1">he), “only pray God for him, he will of himself by reading find what</p>
<p class="calibre1">that error is, and how great its impiety.” At the same time he told</p>
<p class="calibre1">her, how himself, when a little one, had by his seduced mother been</p>
<p class="calibre1">consigned over to the Manichees, and had not only read, but frequently</p>
<p class="calibre1">copied out almost all, their books, and had (without any argument or</p>
<p class="calibre1">proof from any one) seen how much that sect was to be avoided; and had</p>
<p class="calibre1">avoided it. Which when he had said, and she would not be satisfied,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but urged him more, with entreaties and many tears, that he would</p>
<p class="calibre1">see me and discourse with me; he, a little displeased at her</p>
<p class="calibre1">importunity, saith, “Go thy ways and God bless thee, for it is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible that the son of these tears should perish.” Which answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">she took (as she often mentioned in her conversations with me) as if</p>
<p class="calibre1">it had sounded from heaven.</p>
