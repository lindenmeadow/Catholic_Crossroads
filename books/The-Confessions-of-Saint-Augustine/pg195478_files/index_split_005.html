<h2 id="calibre_toc_2" class="calibre7">BOOK I</h2><p class="calibre1">Great art Thou, O Lord, and greatly to be praised; great is Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">power, and Thy wisdom infinite. And Thee would man praise; man, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">a particle of Thy creation; man, that bears about him his mortality,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the witness of his sin, the witness that Thou resistest the proud: yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">would man praise Thee; he, but a particle of Thy creation. Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">awakest us to delight in Thy praise; for Thou madest us for Thyself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and our heart is restless, until it repose in Thee. Grant me, Lord, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know and understand which is first, to call on Thee or to praise Thee?</p>
<p class="calibre1">and, again, to know Thee or to call on Thee? for who can call on Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not knowing Thee? for he that knoweth Thee not, may call on Thee as</p>
<p class="calibre1">other than Thou art. Or, is it rather, that we call on Thee that we</p>
<p class="calibre1">may know Thee? but how shall they call on Him in whom they have not</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed? or how shall they believe without a preacher? and they</p>
<p class="calibre1">that seek the Lord shall praise Him: for they that seek shall find</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him, and they that find shall praise Him. I will seek Thee, Lord, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling on Thee; and will call on Thee, believing in Thee; for to us</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast Thou been preached. My faith, Lord, shall call on Thee, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast given me, wherewith Thou hast inspired me, through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incarnation of Thy Son, through the ministry of the Preacher.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And how shall I call upon my God, my God and Lord, since, when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">call for Him, I shall be calling Him to myself? and what room is there</p>
<p class="calibre1">within me, whither my God can come into me? whither can God come</p>
<p class="calibre1">into me, God who made heaven and earth? is there, indeed, O Lord my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, aught in me that can contain Thee? do then heaven and earth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Thou hast made, and wherein Thou hast made me, contain Thee? or,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because nothing which exists could exist without Thee, doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore whatever exists contain Thee? Since, then, I too exist,</p>
<p class="calibre1">why do I seek that Thou shouldest enter into me, who were not, wert</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou not in me? Why? because I am not gone down in hell, and yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou art there also. For if I go down into hell, Thou art there. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could not be then, O my God, could not be at all, wert Thou not in me;</p>
<p class="calibre1">or, rather, unless I were in Thee, of whom are all things, by whom are</p>
<p class="calibre1">all things, in whom are all things? Even so, Lord, even so. Whither do</p>
<p class="calibre1">I call Thee, since I am in Thee? or whence canst Thou enter into me?</p>
<p class="calibre1">for whither can I go beyond heaven and earth, that thence my God</p>
<p class="calibre1">should come into me, who hath said, I fill the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do the heaven and earth then contain Thee, since Thou fillest</p>
<p class="calibre1">them? or dost Thou fill them and yet overflow, since they do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">contain Thee? And whither, when the heaven and the earth are filled,</p>
<p class="calibre1">pourest Thou forth the remainder of Thyself? or hast Thou no need that</p>
<p class="calibre1">aught contain Thee, who containest all things, since what Thou fillest</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou fillest by containing it? for the vessels which Thou fillest</p>
<p class="calibre1">uphold Thee not, since, though they were broken, Thou wert not</p>
<p class="calibre1">poured out. And when Thou art poured out on us, Thou art not cast</p>
<p class="calibre1">down, but Thou upliftest us; Thou art not dissipated, but Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">gatherest us. But Thou who fillest all things, fillest Thou them</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Thy whole self? or, since all things cannot contain Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">wholly, do they contain part of Thee? and all at once the same part?</p>
<p class="calibre1">or each its own part, the greater more, the smaller less? And is, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">one part of Thee greater, another less? or, art Thou wholly every</p>
<p class="calibre1">where, while nothing contains Thee wholly?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What art Thou then, my God? what, but the Lord God? For who is</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord but the Lord? or who is God save our God? Most highest, most</p>
<p class="calibre1">good, most potent, most omnipotent; most merciful, yet most just; most</p>
<p class="calibre1">hidden, yet most present; most beautiful, yet most strong, stable, yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomprehensible; unchangeable, yet all-changing; never new, never</p>
<p class="calibre1">old; all-renewing, and bringing age upon the proud, and they know it</p>
<p class="calibre1">not; ever working, ever at rest; still gathering, yet nothing lacking;</p>
<p class="calibre1">supporting, filling, and overspreading; creating, nourishing, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">maturing; seeking, yet having all things. Thou lovest, without</p>
<p class="calibre1">passion; art jealous, without anxiety; repentest, yet grievest not;</p>
<p class="calibre1">art angry, yet serene; changest Thy works, Thy purpose unchanged;</p>
<p class="calibre1">receivest again what Thou findest, yet didst never lose; never in</p>
<p class="calibre1">need, yet rejoicing in gains; never covetous, yet exacting usury. Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">receivest over and above, that Thou mayest owe; and who hath aught</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is not Thine? Thou payest debts, owing nothing; remittest</p>
<p class="calibre1">debts, losing nothing. And what had I now said, my God, my life, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">holy joy? or what saith any man when he speaks of Thee? Yet woe to him</p>
<p class="calibre1">that speaketh not, since mute are even the most eloquent.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh! that I might repose on Thee! Oh! that Thou wouldest enter into</p>
<p class="calibre1">my heart, and inebriate it, that I may forget my ills, and embrace</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, my sole good! What art Thou to me? In Thy pity, teach me to</p>
<p class="calibre1">utter it. Or what am I to Thee that Thou demandest my love, and, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">I give it not, art wroth with me, and threatenest me with grievous</p>
<p class="calibre1">woes? Is it then a slight woe to love Thee not? Oh! for Thy mercies’</p>
<p class="calibre1">sake, tell me, O Lord my God, what Thou art unto me. Say unto my soul,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I am thy salvation. So speak, that I may hear. Behold, Lord, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart is before Thee; open Thou the ears thereof, and say unto my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul, I am thy salvation. After this voice let me haste, and take hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">on Thee. Hide not Thy face from me. Let me die-lest I die-only let</p>
<p class="calibre1">me see Thy face.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Narrow is the mansion of my soul; enlarge Thou it, that Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">mayest enter in. It is ruinous; repair Thou it. It has that within</p>
<p class="calibre1">which must offend Thine eyes; I confess and know it. But who shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">cleanse it? or to whom should I cry, save Thee? Lord, cleanse me</p>
<p class="calibre1">from my secret faults, and spare Thy servant from the power of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy. I believe, and therefore do I speak. Lord, Thou knowest. Have I</p>
<p class="calibre1">not confessed against myself my transgressions unto Thee, and Thou, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, hast forgiven the iniquity of my heart? I contend not in judgment</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Thee, who art the truth; I fear to deceive myself; lest mine</p>
<p class="calibre1">iniquity lie unto itself. Therefore I contend not in judgment with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee; for if Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall abide it?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet suffer me to speak unto Thy mercy, me, dust and ashes. Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffer me to speak, since I speak to Thy mercy, and not to scornful</p>
<p class="calibre1">man. Thou too, perhaps, despisest me, yet wilt Thou return and have</p>
<p class="calibre1">compassion upon me. For what would I say, O Lord my God, but that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know not whence I came into this dying life (shall I call it?) or</p>
<p class="calibre1">living death. Then immediately did the comforts of Thy compassion take</p>
<p class="calibre1">me up, as I heard (for I remember it not) from the parents of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh, out of whose substance Thou didst sometime fashion me. Thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">there received me the comforts of woman’s milk. For neither my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother nor my nurses stored their own breasts for me; but Thou didst</p>
<p class="calibre1">bestow the food of my infancy through them, according to Thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinance, whereby Thou distributest Thy riches through the hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">springs of all things. Thou also gavest me to desire no more than Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">gavest; and to my nurses willingly to give me what Thou gavest them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For they, with a heaven-taught affection, willingly gave me what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they abounded with from Thee. For this my good from them, was good for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. Nor, indeed, from them was it, but through them; for from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, O God, are all good things, and from my God is all my health.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This I since learned, Thou, through these Thy gifts, within me and</p>
<p class="calibre1">without, proclaiming Thyself unto me. For then I knew but to suck;</p>
<p class="calibre1">to repose in what pleased, and cry at what offended my flesh;</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing more.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterwards I began to smile; first in sleep, then waking: for so</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was told me of myself, and I believed it; for we see the like in</p>
<p class="calibre1">other infants, though of myself I remember it not. Thus, little by</p>
<p class="calibre1">little, I became conscious where I was; and to have a wish to</p>
<p class="calibre1">express my wishes to those who could content them, and I could not;</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the wishes were within me, and they without; nor could they by any</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense of theirs enter within my spirit. So I flung about at random</p>
<p class="calibre1">limbs and voice, making the few signs I could, and such as I could,</p>
<p class="calibre1">like, though in truth very little like, what I wished. And when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not presently obeyed (my wishes being hurtful or</p>
<p class="calibre1">unintelligible), then I was indignant with my elders for not</p>
<p class="calibre1">submitting to me, with those owing me no service, for not serving</p>
<p class="calibre1">me; and avenged myself on them by tears. Such have I learnt infants to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be from observing them; and that I was myself such, they, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconscious, have shown me better than my nurses who knew it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, lo! my infancy died long since, and I live. But Thou, Lord, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">for ever livest, and in whom nothing dies: for before the foundation</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the worlds, and before all that can be called “before,” Thou art,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and art God and Lord of all which Thou hast created: in Thee abide,</p>
<p class="calibre1">fixed for ever, the first causes of all things unabiding; and of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things changeable, the springs abide in Thee unchangeable: and in Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">live the eternal reasons of all things unreasoning and temporal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Say, Lord, to me, Thy suppliant; say, all-pitying, to me, Thy pitiable</p>
<p class="calibre1">one; say, did my infancy succeed another age of mine that died</p>
<p class="calibre1">before it? was it that which I spent within my mother’s womb? for of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I have heard somewhat, and have myself seen women with child? and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what before that life again, O God my joy, was I any where or any</p>
<p class="calibre1">body? For this have I none to tell me, neither father nor mother,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor experience of others, nor mine own memory. Dost Thou mock me for</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking this, and bid me praise Thee and acknowledge Thee, for that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do know?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I acknowledge Thee, Lord of heaven and earth, and praise Thee for my</p>
<p class="calibre1">first rudiments of being, and my infancy, whereof I remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing; for Thou hast appointed that man should from others guess</p>
<p class="calibre1">much as to himself; and believe much on the strength of weak</p>
<p class="calibre1">females. Even then I had being and life, and (at my infancy’s close) I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could seek for signs whereby to make known to others my sensations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whence could such a being be, save from Thee, Lord? Shall any be his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own artificer? or can there elsewhere be derived any vein, which may</p>
<p class="calibre1">stream essence and life into us, save from thee, O Lord, in whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">essence and life are one? for Thou Thyself art supremely Essence and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Life. For Thou art most high, and art not changed, neither in Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">doth to-day come to a close; yet in Thee doth it come to a close;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because all such things also are in Thee. For they had no way to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pass away, unless Thou upheldest them. And since Thy years fail not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy years are one to-day. How many of ours and our fathers’ years have</p>
<p class="calibre1">flowed away through Thy “to-day,” and from it received the measure and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mould of such being as they had; and still others shall flow away,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and so receive the mould of their degree of being. But Thou art</p>
<p class="calibre1">still the same, and all things of tomorrow, and all beyond, and all of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesterday, and all behind it, Thou hast done to-day. What is it to me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">though any comprehend not this? Let him also rejoice and say, What</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing is this? Let him rejoice even thus! and be content rather by not</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovering to discover Thee, than by discovering not to discover</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hear, O God. Alas, for man’s sin! So saith man, and Thou pitiest</p>
<p class="calibre1">him; for Thou madest him, but sin in him Thou madest not. Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">remindeth me of the sins of my infancy? for in Thy sight none is</p>
<p class="calibre1">pure from sin, not even the infant whose life is but a day upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth. Who remindeth me? doth not each little infant, in whom I see</p>
<p class="calibre1">what of myself I remember not? What then was my sin? was it that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hung upon the breast and cried? for should I now so do for food</p>
<p class="calibre1">suitable to my age, justly should I be laughed at and reproved. What I</p>
<p class="calibre1">then did was worthy reproof; but since I could not understand reproof,</p>
<p class="calibre1">custom and reason forbade me to be reproved. For those habits, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">grown, we root out and cast away. Now no man, though he prunes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wittingly casts away what is good. Or was it then good, even for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">while, to cry for what, if given, would hurt? bitterly to resent, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons free, and its own elders, yea, the very authors of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">birth, served it not? that many besides, wiser than it, obeyed not the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nod of its good pleasure? to do its best to strike and hurt, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">commands were not obeyed, which had been obeyed to its hurt? The</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakness then of infant limbs, not its will, is its innocence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Myself have seen and known even a baby envious; it could not speak,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet it turned pale and looked bitterly on its foster-brother. Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows not this? Mothers and nurses tell you that they allay these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things by I know not what remedies. Is that too innocence, when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fountain of milk is flowing in rich abundance, not to endure one to</p>
<p class="calibre1">share it, though in extremest need, and whose very life as yet depends</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereon? We bear gently with all this, not as being no or slight</p>
<p class="calibre1">evils, but because they will disappear as years increase; for,</p>
<p class="calibre1">though tolerated now, the very same tempers are utterly intolerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">when found in riper years.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, then, O Lord my God, who gavest life to this my infancy,</p>
<p class="calibre1">furnishing thus with senses (as we see) the frame Thou gavest,</p>
<p class="calibre1">compacting its limbs, ornamenting its proportions, and, for its</p>
<p class="calibre1">general good and safety, implanting in it all vital functions, Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">commandest me to praise Thee in these things, to confess unto Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sing unto Thy name, Thou most Highest. For Thou art God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Almighty and Good, even hadst Thou done nought but only this, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">none could do but Thou: whose Unity is the mould of all things; who</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of Thy own fairness makest all things fair; and orderest all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things by Thy law. This age then, Lord, whereof I have no remembrance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which I take on others’ word, and guess from other infants that I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed, true though the guess be, I am yet loth to count in this</p>
<p class="calibre1">life of mine which I live in this world. For no less than that which I</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent in my mother’s womb, is it hid from me in the shadows of</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgetfulness. But if I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother conceive me, where, I beseech Thee, O my God, where, Lord, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">when, was I Thy servant guiltless? But, lo! that period I pass by; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what have I now to do with that, of which I can recall no vestige?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Passing hence from infancy, I came to boyhood, or rather it came</p>
<p class="calibre1">to me, displacing infancy. Nor did that depart,- (for whither went</p>
<p class="calibre1">it?)- and yet it was no more. For I was no longer a speechless infant,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but a speaking boy. This I remember; and have since observed how I</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned to speak. It was not that my elders taught me words (as,</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon after, other learning) in any set method; but I, longing by cries</p>
<p class="calibre1">and broken accents and various motions of my limbs to express my</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts, that so I might have my will, and yet unable to express</p>
<p class="calibre1">all I willed, or to whom I willed, did myself, by the understanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Thou, my God, gavest me, practise the sounds in my memory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When they named any thing, and as they spoke turned towards it, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw and remembered that they called what they would point out by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">name they uttered. And that they meant this thing and no other was</p>
<p class="calibre1">plain from the motion of their body, the natural language, as it were,</p>
<p class="calibre1">of all nations, expressed by the countenance, glances of the eye,</p>
<p class="calibre1">gestures of the limbs, and tones of the voice, indicating the</p>
<p class="calibre1">affections of the mind, as it pursues, possesses, rejects, or shuns.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And thus by constantly hearing words, as they occurred in various</p>
<p class="calibre1">sentences, I collected gradually for what they stood; and having</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken in my mouth to these signs, I thereby gave utterance to my</p>
<p class="calibre1">will. Thus I exchanged with those about me these current signs of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our wills, and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse of human</p>
<p class="calibre1">life, yet depending on parental authority and the beck of elders.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O God my God, what miseries and mockeries did I now experience, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">obedience to my teachers was proposed to me, as proper in a boy, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">order that in this world I might prosper, and excel in tongue-science,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which should serve to the “praise of men,” and to deceitful riches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next I was put to school to get learning, in which I (poor wretch)</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew not what use there was; and yet, if idle in learning, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten. For this was judged right by our forefathers; and many,</p>
<p class="calibre1">passing the same course before us, framed for us weary paths,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through which we were fain to pass; multiplying toil and grief upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sons of Adam. But, Lord, we found that men called upon Thee, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we learnt from them to think of Thee (according to our powers) as of</p>
<p class="calibre1">some great One, who, though hidden from our senses, couldest hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">and help us. For so I began, as a boy, to pray to Thee, my aid and</p>
<p class="calibre1">refuge; and broke the fetters of my tongue to call on Thee, praying</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, though small, yet with no small earnestness, that I might not be</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten at school. And when Thou heardest me not (not thereby giving me</p>
<p class="calibre1">over to folly), my elders, yea my very parents, who yet wished me no</p>
<p class="calibre1">ill, mocked my stripes, my then great and grievous ill.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is there, Lord, any of soul so great, and cleaving to Thee with so</p>
<p class="calibre1">intense affection (for a sort of stupidity will in a way do it); but</p>
<p class="calibre1">is there any one who, from cleaving devoutly to Thee, is endued with</p>
<p class="calibre1">so great a spirit, that he can think as lightly of the racks and hooks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and other torments (against which, throughout all lands, men call on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee with extreme dread), mocking at those by whom they are feared</p>
<p class="calibre1">most bitterly, as our parents mocked the torments which we suffered in</p>
<p class="calibre1">boyhood from our masters? For we feared not our torments less; nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">prayed we less to Thee to escape them. And yet we sinned, in writing</p>
<p class="calibre1">or reading or studying less than was exacted of us. For we wanted not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">O Lord, memory or capacity, whereof Thy will gave enough for our</p>
<p class="calibre1">age; but our sole delight was play; and for this we were punished by</p>
<p class="calibre1">those who yet themselves were doing the like. But elder folks’</p>
<p class="calibre1">idleness is called “business”; that of boys, being really the same, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">punished by those elders; and none commiserates either boys or men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For will any of sound discretion approve of my being beaten as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy, because, by playing a ball, I made less progress in studies which</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was to learn, only that, as a man, I might play more</p>
<p class="calibre1">unbeseemingly? and what else did he who beat me? who, if worsted in</p>
<p class="calibre1">some trifling discussion with his fellow-tutor, was more embittered</p>
<p class="calibre1">and jealous than I when beaten at ball by a play-fellow?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet, I sinned herein, O Lord God, the Creator and Disposer of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all things in nature, of sin the Disposer only, O Lord my God, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinned in transgressing the commands of my parents and those of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">masters. For what they, with whatever motive, would have me learn, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might afterwards have put to good use. For I disobeyed, not from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">better choice, but from love of play, loving the pride of victory in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my contests, and to have my ears tickled with lying fables, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they might itch the more; the same curiosity flashing from my eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">more and more, for the shows and games of my elders. Yet those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">give these shows are in such esteem, that almost all wish the same for</p>
<p class="calibre1">their children, and yet are very willing that they should be beaten,</p>
<p class="calibre1">if those very games detain them from the studies, whereby they would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have them attain to be the givers of them. Look with pity, Lord, on</p>
<p class="calibre1">these things, and deliver us who call upon Thee now; deliver those too</p>
<p class="calibre1">who call not on Thee yet, that they may call on Thee, and Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">mayest deliver them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">As a boy, then, I had already heard of an eternal life, promised</p>
<p class="calibre1">us through the humility of the Lord our God stooping to our pride; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">even from the womb of my mother, who greatly hoped in Thee, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sealed with the mark of His cross and salted with His salt. Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">sawest, Lord, how while yet a boy, being seized on a time with</p>
<p class="calibre1">sudden oppression of the stomach, and like near to death-Thou sawest,</p>
<p class="calibre1">my God (for Thou wert my keeper), with what eagerness and what faith I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sought, from the pious care of my mother and Thy Church, the mother of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us all, the baptism of Thy Christ, my God and Lord. Whereupon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother my flesh, being much troubled (since, with a heart pure in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy faith, she even more lovingly travailed in birth of my salvation),</p>
<p class="calibre1">would in eager haste have provided for my consecration and cleansing</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the health-giving sacraments, confessing Thee, Lord Jesus, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the remission of sins, unless I had suddenly recovered. And so, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if I must needs be again polluted should I live, my cleansing was</p>
<p class="calibre1">deferred, because the defilements of sin would, after that washing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">bring greater and more perilous guilt. I then already believed: and my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother, and the whole household, except my father: yet did not he</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevail over the power of my mother’s piety in me, that as he did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not yet believe, so neither should I. For it was her earnest care that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou my God, rather than he, shouldest be my father; and in this</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou didst aid her to prevail over her husband, whom she, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">better, obeyed, therein also obeying Thee, who hast so commanded.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">I beseech Thee, my God, I would fain know, if so Thou willest, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">what purpose my baptism was then deferred? was it for my good that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rein was laid loose, as it were, upon me, for me to sin? or was it not</p>
<p class="calibre1">laid loose? If not, why does it still echo in our ears on all sides,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let him alone, let him do as he will, for he is not yet baptised?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">but as to bodily health, no one says, “Let him be worse wounded, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">he is not yet healed.” How much better then, had I been at once</p>
<p class="calibre1">healed; and then, by my friends’ and my own, my soul’s recovered</p>
<p class="calibre1">health had been kept safe in Thy keeping who gavest it. Better</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly. But how many and great waves of temptation seemed to hang</p>
<p class="calibre1">over me after my boyhood! These my mother foresaw; and preferred to</p>
<p class="calibre1">expose to them the clay whence I might afterwards be moulded, than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">very cast, when made.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">In boyhood itself, however (so much less dreaded for me than youth),</p>
<p class="calibre1">I loved not study, and hated to be forced to it. Yet I was forced; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">this was well done towards me, but I did not well; for, unless forced,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had not learnt. But no one doth well against his will, even though</p>
<p class="calibre1">what he doth, be well. Yet neither did they well who forced me, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was well came to me from Thee, my God. For they were regardless</p>
<p class="calibre1">how I should employ what they forced me to learn, except to satiate</p>
<p class="calibre1">the insatiate desires of a wealthy beggary, and a shameful glory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Thou, by whom the very hairs of our head are numbered, didst use</p>
<p class="calibre1">for my good the error of all who urged me to learn; and my own, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not learn, Thou didst use for my punishment-a fit penalty for</p>
<p class="calibre1">one, so small a boy and so great a sinner. So by those who did not</p>
<p class="calibre1">well, Thou didst well for me; and by my own sin Thou didst justly</p>
<p class="calibre1">punish me. For Thou hast commanded, and so it is, that every</p>
<p class="calibre1">inordinate affection should be its own punishment.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But why did I so much hate the Greek, which I studied as a boy? I do</p>
<p class="calibre1">not yet fully know. For the Latin I loved; not what my first</p>
<p class="calibre1">masters, but what the socalled grammarians taught me. For those first</p>
<p class="calibre1">lessons, reading, writing and arithmetic, I thought as great a</p>
<p class="calibre1">burden and penalty as any Greek. And yet whence was this too, but from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sin and vanity of this life, because I was flesh, and a breath</p>
<p class="calibre1">that passeth away and cometh not again? For those first lessons were</p>
<p class="calibre1">better certainly, because more certain; by them I obtained, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">still retain, the power of reading what I find written, and myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">writing what I will; whereas in the others, I was forced to learn</p>
<p class="calibre1">the wanderings of one Aeneas, forgetful of my own, and to weep for</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead Dido, because she killed herself for love; the while, with dry</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes, I endured my miserable self dying among these things, far from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, O God my life.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For what more miserable than a miserable being who commiserates</p>
<p class="calibre1">not himself; weeping the death of Dido for love to Aeneas, but weeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">not his own death for want of love to Thee, O God. Thou light of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, Thou bread of my inmost soul, Thou Power who givest vigour to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my mind, who quickenest my thoughts, I loved Thee not. I committed</p>
<p class="calibre1">fornication against Thee, and all around me thus fornicating there</p>
<p class="calibre1">echoed “Well done! well done!” for the friendship of this world is</p>
<p class="calibre1">fornication against Thee; and “Well done! well done!” echoes on till</p>
<p class="calibre1">one is ashamed not to he thus a man. And for all this I wept not, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">who wept for Dido slain, and “seeking by the sword a stroke and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wound extreme,” myself seeking the while a worse extreme, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">extremest and lowest of Thy creatures, having forsaken Thee, earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">passing into the earth. And if forbid to read all this, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">grieved that I might not read what grieved me. Madness like this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought a higher and a richer learning, than that by which I learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to read and write.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now, my God, cry Thou aloud in my soul; and let Thy truth tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, “Not so, not so. Far better was that first study.” For, lo, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would readily forget the wanderings of Aeneas and all the rest, rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than how to read and write. But over the entrance of the Grammar</p>
<p class="calibre1">School is a vail drawn! true; yet is this not so much an emblem of</p>
<p class="calibre1">aught recondite, as a cloak of error. Let not those, whom I no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer fear, cry out against me, while I confess to Thee, my God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever my soul will, and acquiesce in the condemnation of my evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways, that I may love Thy good ways. Let not either buyers or</p>
<p class="calibre1">sellers of grammar-learning cry out against me. For if I question them</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether it be true that Aeneas came on a time to Carthage, as the poet</p>
<p class="calibre1">tells, the less learned will reply that they know not, the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned that he never did. But should I ask with what letters the name</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aeneas” is written, every one who has learnt this will answer me</p>
<p class="calibre1">aright, as to the signs which men have conventionally settled. If,</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, I should ask which might be forgotten with least detriment to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the concerns of life, reading and writing or these poetic fictions?</p>
<p class="calibre1">who does not foresee what all must answer who have not wholly</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten themselves? I sinned, then, when as a boy I preferred</p>
<p class="calibre1">those empty to those more profitable studies, or rather loved the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one and hated the other. “One and one, two”; “two and two, four”; this</p>
<p class="calibre1">was to me a hateful singsong: “the wooden horse lined with armed men,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">and “the burning of Troy,” and “Creusa’s shade and sad similitude,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">were the choice spectacle of my vanity.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why then did I hate the Greek classics, which have the like tales?</p>
<p class="calibre1">For Homer also curiously wove the like fictions, and is most</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweetlyvain, yet was he bitter to my boyish taste. And so I suppose</p>
<p class="calibre1">would Virgil be to Grecian children, when forced to learn him as I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Homer. Difficulty, in truth, the difficulty of a foreign tongue,</p>
<p class="calibre1">dashed, as it were, with gall all the sweetness of Grecian fable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For not one word of it did I understand, and to make me understand I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was urged vehemently with cruel threats and punishments. Time was also</p>
<p class="calibre1">(as an infant) I knew no Latin; but this I learned without fear or</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering, by mere observation, amid the caresses of my nursery and</p>
<p class="calibre1">jests of friends, smiling and sportively encouraging me. This I</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned without any pressure of punishment to urge me on, for my heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">urged me to give birth to its conceptions, which I could only do by</p>
<p class="calibre1">learning words not of those who taught, but of those who talked with</p>
<p class="calibre1">me; in whose ears also I gave birth to the thoughts, whatever I</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceived. No doubt, then, that a free curiosity has more force in our</p>
<p class="calibre1">learning these things, than a frightful enforcement. Only this</p>
<p class="calibre1">enforcement restrains the rovings of that freedom, through Thy laws, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">my God, Thy laws, from the master’s cane to the martyr’s trials, being</p>
<p class="calibre1">able to temper for us a wholesome bitter, recalling us to Thyself from</p>
<p class="calibre1">that deadly pleasure which lures us from Thee.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hear, Lord, my prayer; let not my soul faint under Thy discipline,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor let me faint in confessing unto Thee all Thy mercies, whereby Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast drawn me out of all my most evil ways, that Thou mightest</p>
<p class="calibre1">become a delight to me above all the allurements which I once pursued;</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I may most entirely love Thee, and clasp Thy hand with all my</p>
<p class="calibre1">affections, and Thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation,</p>
<p class="calibre1">even unto the end. For lo, O Lord, my King and my God, for Thy service</p>
<p class="calibre1">be whatever useful thing my childhood learned; for Thy service, that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak, write, read, reckon. For Thou didst grant me Thy discipline,</p>
<p class="calibre1">while I was learning vanities; and my sin of delighting in those</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanities Thou hast forgiven. In them, indeed, I learnt many a useful</p>
<p class="calibre1">word, but these may as well be learned in things not vain; and that is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the safe path for the steps of youth.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But woe is thee, thou torrent of human custom! Who shall stand</p>
<p class="calibre1">against thee? how long shalt thou not be dried up? how long roll the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sons of Eve into that huge and hideous ocean, which even they scarcely</p>
<p class="calibre1">overpass who climb the cross? Did not I read in thee of Jove the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thunderer and the adulterer? both, doubtless, he could not be; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">so the feigned thunder might countenance and pander to real</p>
<p class="calibre1">adultery. And now which of our gowned masters lends a sober ear to one</p>
<p class="calibre1">who from their own school cries out, “These were Homer’s fictions,</p>
<p class="calibre1">transferring things human to the gods; would he had brought down</p>
<p class="calibre1">things divine to us!” Yet more truly had he said, “These are indeed</p>
<p class="calibre1">his fictions; but attributing a divine nature to wicked men, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">crimes might be no longer crimes, and whoso commits them might seem to</p>
<p class="calibre1">imitate not abandoned men, but the celestial gods.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet, thou hellish torrent, into thee are cast the sons of men</p>
<p class="calibre1">with rich rewards, for compassing such learning; and a great solemnity</p>
<p class="calibre1">is made of it, when this is going on in the forum, within sight of</p>
<p class="calibre1">laws appointing a salary beside the scholar’s payments; and thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">lashest thy rocks and roarest, “Hence words are learnt; hence</p>
<p class="calibre1">eloquence; most necessary to gain your ends, or maintain opinions.” As</p>
<p class="calibre1">if we should have never known such words as “golden shower,” “lap,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“beguile,” “temples of the heavens,” or others in that passage, unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">Terence had brought a lewd youth upon the stage, setting up Jupiter as</p>
<p class="calibre1">his example of seduction.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">“Viewing a picture, where the tale was drawn,</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of Jove’s descending in a golden shower</p>
<p class="calibre4">To Danae’s lap a woman to beguile.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then mark how he excites himself to lust as by celestial</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority:</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">“And what God? Great Jove,</p>
<p class="calibre4">Who shakes heaven’s highest temples with his thunder,</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">And I, poor mortal man, not do the same!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I did it, and with all my heart I did it.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not one whit more easily are the words learnt for all this vileness;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but by their means the vileness is committed with less shame. Not that</p>
<p class="calibre1">I blame the words, being, as it were, choice and precious vessels; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">that wine of error which is drunk to us in them by intoxicated</p>
<p class="calibre1">teachers; and if we, too, drink not, we are beaten, and have no</p>
<p class="calibre1">sober judge to whom we may appeal. Yet, O my God (in whose presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">I now without hurt may remember this), all this unhappily I learnt</p>
<p class="calibre1">willingly with great delight, and for this was pronounced a hopeful</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bear with me, my God, while I say somewhat of my wit, Thy gift,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and on what dotages I wasted it. For a task was set me, troublesome</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough to my soul, upon terms of praise or shame, and fear of stripes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to speak the words of Juno, as she raged and mourned that she could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">“This Trojan prince from Latinum turn.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which words I had heard that Juno never uttered; but we were forced to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go astray in the footsteps of these poetic fictions, and to say in</p>
<p class="calibre1">prose much what he expressed in verse. And his speaking was most</p>
<p class="calibre1">applauded, in whom the passions of rage and grief were most</p>
<p class="calibre1">preeminent, and clothed in the most fitting language, maintaining</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dignity of the character. What is it to me, O my true life, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, that my declamation was applauded above so many of my own age and</p>
<p class="calibre1">class? is not all this smoke and wind? and was there nothing else</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereon to exercise my wit and tongue? Thy praises, Lord, Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">praises might have stayed the yet tender shoot of my heart by the prop</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thy Scriptures; so had it not trailed away amid these empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">trifles, a defiled prey for the fowls of the air. For in more ways</p>
<p class="calibre1">than one do men sacrifice to the rebellious angels.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what marvel that I was thus carried away to vanities, and went</p>
<p class="calibre1">out from Thy presence, O my God, when men were set before me as</p>
<p class="calibre1">models, who, if in relating some action of theirs, in itself not</p>
<p class="calibre1">ill, they committed some barbarism or solecism, being censured, were</p>
<p class="calibre1">abashed; but when in rich and adomed and well-ordered discourse they</p>
<p class="calibre1">related their own disordered life, being bepraised, they gloried?</p>
<p class="calibre1">These things Thou seest, Lord, and holdest Thy peace;</p>
<p class="calibre1">long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. Wilt Thou hold Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">peace for ever? and even now Thou drawest out of this horrible gulf</p>
<p class="calibre1">the soul that seeketh Thee, that thirsteth for Thy pleasures, whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart saith unto Thee, I have sought Thy face; Thy face, Lord, will</p>
<p class="calibre1">I seek. For darkened affections is removal from Thee. For it is not by</p>
<p class="calibre1">our feet, or change of place, that men leave Thee, or return unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. Or did that Thy younger son look out for horses or chariots,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or ships, fly with visible wings, or journey by the motion of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">limbs, that he might in a far country waste in riotous living all Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">gavest at his departure? a loving Father, when Thou gavest, and more</p>
<p class="calibre1">loving unto him, when he returned empty. So then in lustful, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is, in darkened affections, is the true distance from Thy face.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold, O Lord God, yea, behold patiently as Thou art wont how</p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully the sons of men observe the covenanted rules of letters</p>
<p class="calibre1">and syllables received from those who spake before them, neglecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the eternal covenant of everlasting salvation received from Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Insomuch, that a teacher or learner of the hereditary laws of</p>
<p class="calibre1">pronunciation will more offend men by speaking without the aspirate,</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a “uman being,” in despite of the laws of grammar, than if he, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“human being,” hate a “human being” in despite of Thine. As if any</p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy could be more hurtful than the hatred with which he is</p>
<p class="calibre1">incensed against him; or could wound more deeply him whom he</p>
<p class="calibre1">persecutes, than he wounds his own soul by his enmity. Assuredly no</p>
<p class="calibre1">science of letters can be so innate as the record of conscience, “that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he is doing to another what from another he would be loth to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffer.” How deep are Thy ways, O God, Thou only great, that sittest</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent on high and by an unwearied law dispensing penal blindness to</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawless desires. In quest of the fame of eloquence, a man standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">before a human judge, surrounded by a human throng, declaiming against</p>
<p class="calibre1">his enemy with fiercest hatred, will take heed most watchfully,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lest, by an error of the tongue, he murder the word “human being”; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes no heed, lest, through the fury of his spirit, he murder the</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the world at whose gate unhappy I lay in my boyhood; this</p>
<p class="calibre1">the stage where I had feared more to commit a barbarism, than having</p>
<p class="calibre1">committed one, to envy those who had not. These things I speak and</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess to Thee, my God; for which I had praise from them, whom I then</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought it all virtue to please. For I saw not the abyss of</p>
<p class="calibre1">vileness, wherein I was cast away from Thine eyes. Before them what</p>
<p class="calibre1">more foul than I was already, displeasing even such as myself? with</p>
<p class="calibre1">innumerable lies deceiving my tutor, my masters, my parents, from love</p>
<p class="calibre1">of play, eagerness to see vain shows and restlessness to imitate them!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thefts also I committed, from my parents’ cellar and table, enslaved</p>
<p class="calibre1">by greediness, or that I might have to give to boys, who sold me their</p>
<p class="calibre1">play, which all the while they liked no less than I. In this play,</p>
<p class="calibre1">too, I often sought unfair conquests, conquered myself meanwhile by</p>
<p class="calibre1">vain desire of preeminence. And what could I so ill endure, or, when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">detected it, upbraided I so fiercely, as that I was doing to others?</p>
<p class="calibre1">and for which if, detected, I was upbraided, I chose rather to quarrel</p>
<p class="calibre1">than to yield. And is this the innocence of boyhood? Not so, Lord, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">so; I cry Thy mercy, my God. For these very sins, as riper years</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeed, these very sins are transferred from tutors and masters, from</p>
<p class="calibre1">nuts and balls and sparrows, to magistrates and kings, to gold and</p>
<p class="calibre1">manors and slaves, just as severer punishments displace the cane. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the low stature then of childhood which Thou our King didst</p>
<p class="calibre1">commend as an emblem of lowliness, when Thou saidst, Of such is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet, Lord, to Thee, the Creator and Governor of the universe, most</p>
<p class="calibre1">excellent and most good, thanks were due to Thee our God, even hadst</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou destined for me boyhood only. For even then I was, I lived, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt; and had an implanted providence over my well-being- a trace of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that mysterious Unity whence I was derived; I guarded by the inward</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense the entireness of my senses, and in these minute pursuits, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in my thoughts on things minute, I learnt to delight in truth, I hated</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be deceived, had a vigorous memory, was gifted with speech, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">soothed by friendship, avoided pain, baseness, ignorance. In so</p>
<p class="calibre1">small a creature, what was not wonderful, not admirable? But all are</p>
<p class="calibre1">gifts of my God: it was not I who gave them me; and good these are,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and these together are myself. Good, then, is He that made me, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">He is my good; and before Him will I exult for every good which of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy I had. For it was my sin, that not in Him, but in His creatures-myself and others-I sought for pleasures, sublimities, truths, and so</p>
<p class="calibre1">fell headlong into sorrows, confusions, errors. Thanks be to Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">my joy and my glory and my confidence, my God, thanks be to Thee for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy gifts; but do Thou preserve them to me. For so wilt Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">preserve me, and those things shall be enlarged and perfected which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast given me, and I myself shall be with Thee, since even to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be Thou hast given me.</p>
