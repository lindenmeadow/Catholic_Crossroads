<h2 id="calibre_toc_11" class="calibre7">BOOK X</h2><p class="calibre1">Let me know Thee, O Lord, who knowest me: let me know Thee, as I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am known. Power of my soul, enter into it, and fit it for Thee, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou mayest have and hold it without spot or wrinkle. This is my hope,</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore do I speak; and in this hope do I rejoice, when I rejoice</p>
<p class="calibre1">healthfully. Other things of this life are the less to be sorrowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">for, the more they are sorrowed for; and the more to be sorrowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">for, the less men sorrow for them. For behold, Thou lovest the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth, and he that doth it, cometh to the light. This would I do in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart before Thee in confession: and in my writing, before many</p>
<p class="calibre1">witnesses.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And from Thee, O Lord, unto whose eyes the abyss of man’s conscience</p>
<p class="calibre1">is naked, what could be hidden in me though I would not confess it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">For I should hide Thee from me, not me from Thee. But now, for that my</p>
<p class="calibre1">groaning is witness, that I am displeased with myself, Thou shinest</p>
<p class="calibre1">out, and art pleasing, and beloved, and longed for; that I may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">ashamed of myself, and renounce myself, and choose Thee, and neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">please Thee nor myself, but in Thee. To Thee therefore, O Lord, am I</p>
<p class="calibre1">open, whatever I am; and with what fruit I confess unto Thee, I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">said. Nor do I it with words and sounds of the flesh, but with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">words of my soul, and the cry of the thought which Thy ear knoweth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For when I am evil, then to confess to Thee is nothing else than to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">displeased with myself; but when holy, nothing else than not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ascribe it to myself: because Thou, O Lord, blessest the godly, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">first Thou justifieth him when ungodly. My confession then, O my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, in Thy sight, is made silently, and not silently. For in sound,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is silent; in affection, it cries aloud. For neither do I utter any</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing right unto men, which Thou hast not before heard from me; nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">dost Thou hear any such thing from me, which Thou hast not first</p>
<p class="calibre1">said unto me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then have I to do with men, that they should hear my</p>
<p class="calibre1">confessions-as if they could heal all my infirmities-a race, curious</p>
<p class="calibre1">to know the lives of others, slothful to amend their own? Why seek</p>
<p class="calibre1">they to hear from me what I am; who will not hear from Thee what</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves are? And how know they, when from myself they hear of</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself, whether I say true; seeing no man knows what is in man, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spirit of man which is in him? But if they hear from Thee of</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves, they cannot say, “The Lord lieth.” For what is it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear from Thee of themselves, but to know themselves? and who</p>
<p class="calibre1">knoweth and saith, “It is false,” unless himself lieth? But because</p>
<p class="calibre1">charity believeth all things (that is, among those whom knitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto itself it maketh one), I also, O Lord, will in such wise</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess unto Thee, that men may hear, to whom I cannot demonstrate</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether I confess truly; yet they believe me, whose ears charity</p>
<p class="calibre1">openeth unto me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But do Thou, my inmost Physician, make plain unto me what fruit I</p>
<p class="calibre1">may reap by doing it. For the confessions of my past sins, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast forgiven and covered, that Thou mightest bless me in Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing my soul by Faith and Thy Sacrament, when read and heard, stir</p>
<p class="calibre1">up the heart, that it sleep not in despair and say “I cannot,” but</p>
<p class="calibre1">awake in the love of Thy mercy and the sweetness of Thy grace, whereby</p>
<p class="calibre1">whoso is weak, is strong, when by it he became conscious of his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakness. And the good delight to hear of the past evils of such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">are now freed from them, not because they are evils, but because</p>
<p class="calibre1">they have been and are not. With what fruit then, O Lord my God, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whom my conscience daily confesseth, trusting more in the hope of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy mercy than in her own innocency, with what fruit, I pray, do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">by this book confess to men also in Thy presence what I now am, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I have been? For that other fruit I have seen and spoken of.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what I now am, at the very time of making these confessions,</p>
<p class="calibre1">divers desire to know, who have or have not known me, who have heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">from me or of me; but their ear is not at my heart where I am,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever I am. They wish then to hear me confess what I am within;</p>
<p class="calibre1">whither neither their eye, nor ear, nor understanding can reach;</p>
<p class="calibre1">they wish it, as ready to believe-but will they know? For charity,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby they are good, telleth them that in my confessions I lie</p>
<p class="calibre1">not; and she in them, believeth me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for what fruit would they hear this? Do they desire to joy</p>
<p class="calibre1">with me, when they hear how near, by Thy gift, I approach unto Thee?</p>
<p class="calibre1">and to pray for me, when they shall hear how much I am held back by my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own weight? To such will I discover myself For it is no mean fruit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">O Lord my God, that by many thanks should be given to Thee on our</p>
<p class="calibre1">behalf, and Thou be by many entreated for us. Let the brotherly mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">love in me what Thou teachest is to be loved, and lament in me what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou teachest is to be lamented. Let a brotherly, not a stranger,</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind, not that of the strange children, whose mouth talketh of vanity,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity, but that brotherly</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind which when it approveth, rejoiceth for me, and when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">disapproveth me, is sorry for me; because whether it approveth or</p>
<p class="calibre1">disapproveth, it loveth me. To such will I discover myself: they</p>
<p class="calibre1">will breathe freely at my good deeds, sigh for my ill. My good deeds</p>
<p class="calibre1">are Thine appointments, and Thy gifts; my evil ones are my offences,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Thy judgments. Let them breathe freely at the one, sigh at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other; and let hymns and weeping go up into Thy sight, out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearts of my brethren, Thy censers. And do Thou, O Lord, he pleased</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the incense of Thy holy temple, have mercy upon me according to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy great mercy for Thine own name’s sake; and no ways forsaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">what Thou hast begun, perfect my imperfections.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the fruit of my confessions of what I am, not of what I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been, to confess this, not before Thee only, in a secret exultation</p>
<p class="calibre1">with trembling, and a secret sorrow with hope; but in the ears also of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the believing sons of men, sharers of my joy, and partners in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mortality, my fellow-citizens, and fellow-pilgrims, who are gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">before, or are to follow on, companions of my way. These are Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">servants, my brethren, whom Thou willest to be Thy sons; my masters,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom Thou commandest me to serve, if I would live with Thee, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. But this Thy Word were little did it only command by speaking,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and not go before in performing. This then I do in deed and word, this</p>
<p class="calibre1">I do under Thy wings; in over great peril, were not my soul subdued</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thee under Thy wings, and my infirmity known unto Thee. I am a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little one, but my Father ever liveth, and my Guardian is sufficient</p>
<p class="calibre1">for me. For He is the same who begat me, and defends me: and Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyself art all my good; Thou, Almighty, Who are with me, yea,</p>
<p class="calibre1">before I am with Thee. To such then whom Thou commandest me to serve</p>
<p class="calibre1">will I discover, not what I have been, but what I now am and what I</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet am. But neither do I judge myself. Thus therefore I would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Thou, Lord, dost judge me: because, although no man knoweth</p>
<p class="calibre1">the things of a man, but the spirit of a man which is in him, yet is</p>
<p class="calibre1">there something of man, which neither the spirit of man that is in</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, itself knoweth. But Thou, Lord, knowest all of him, Who hast made</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. Yet I, though in Thy sight I despise myself, and account myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">dust and ashes; yet know I something of Thee, which I know not of</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself. And truly, now we see through a glass darkly, not face to face</p>
<p class="calibre1">as yet. So long therefore as I be absent from Thee, I am more</p>
<p class="calibre1">present with myself than with Thee; and yet know I Thee that Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">art in no ways passible; but I, what temptations I can resist, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">I cannot, I know not. And there is hope, because Thou art faithful,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Who wilt not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">wilt with the temptation also make a way to escape, that we may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">able to bear it. I will confess then what I know of myself, I will</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess also what I know not of myself. And that because what I do</p>
<p class="calibre1">know of myself, I know by Thy shining upon me; and what I know not</p>
<p class="calibre1">of myself, so long know I not it, until my darkness be made as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">noon-day in Thy countenance.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not with doubting, but with assured consciousness, do I love Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord. Thou hast stricken my heart with Thy word, and I loved Thee. Yea</p>
<p class="calibre1">also heaven, and earth, and all that therein is, behold, on every side</p>
<p class="calibre1">they bid me love Thee; nor cease to say so unto all, that they may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be without excuse. But more deeply wilt Thou have mercy on whom Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">wilt have mercy, and wilt have compassion on whom Thou hast had</p>
<p class="calibre1">compassion: else in deaf ears do the heaven and the earth speak Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">praises. But what do I love, when I love Thee? not beauty of bodies,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor the fair harmony of time, nor the brightness of the light, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">gladsome to our eyes, nor sweet melodies of varied songs, nor the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fragrant smell of flowers, and ointments, and spices, not manna and</p>
<p class="calibre1">honey, not limbs acceptable to embracements of flesh. None of these</p>
<p class="calibre1">I love, when I love my God; and yet I love a kind of light, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">melody, and fragrance, and meat, and embracement when I love my God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the light, melody, fragrance, meat, embracement of my inner man: where</p>
<p class="calibre1">there shineth unto my soul what space cannot contain, and there</p>
<p class="calibre1">soundeth what time beareth not away, and there smelleth what breathing</p>
<p class="calibre1">disperseth not, and there tasteth what eating diminisheth not, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there clingeth what satiety divorceth not. This is it which I love</p>
<p class="calibre1">when I love my God.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what is this? I asked the earth, and it answered me, “I am not</p>
<p class="calibre1">He”; and whatsoever are in it confessed the same. I asked the sea</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the deeps, and the living creeping things, and they answered,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are not thy God, seek above us.” I asked the moving air; and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole air with his inhabitants answered, “Anaximenes was deceived, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am not God. ” I asked the heavens, sun, moon, stars, “Nor (say they)</p>
<p class="calibre1">are we the God whom thou seekest.” And I replied unto all the things</p>
<p class="calibre1">which encompass the door of my flesh: “Ye have told me of my God, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye are not He; tell me something of Him.” And they cried out with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">loud voice, “He made us. ” My questioning them, was my thoughts on</p>
<p class="calibre1">them: and their form of beauty gave the answer. And I turned myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto myself, and said to myself, “Who art thou?” And I answered, “A</p>
<p class="calibre1">man.” And behold, in me there present themselves to me soul, and body,</p>
<p class="calibre1">one without, the other within. By which of these ought I to seek my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God? I had sought Him in the body from earth to heaven, so far as I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could send messengers, the beams of mine eyes. But the better is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inner, for to it as presiding and judging, all the bodily messengers</p>
<p class="calibre1">reported the answers of heaven and earth, and all things therein,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who said, “We are not God, but He made us.” These things did my</p>
<p class="calibre1">inner man know by the ministry of the outer: I the inner knew them; I,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mind, through the senses of my body. I asked the whole frame of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world about my God; and it answered me, “I am not He, but He</p>
<p class="calibre1">made me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is not this corporeal figure apparent to all whose senses are</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfect? why then speaks it not the same to all? Animals small and</p>
<p class="calibre1">great see it, but they cannot ask it: because no reason is set over</p>
<p class="calibre1">their senses to judge on what they report. But men can ask, so that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the invisible things of God are clearly seen, being understood by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the things that are made; but by love of them, they are made subject</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto them: and subjects cannot judge. Nor yet do the creatures</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer such as ask, unless they can judge; nor yet do they change</p>
<p class="calibre1">their voice (i.e., their appearance), if one man only sees, another</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing asks, so as to appear one way to this man, another way to that,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but appearing the same way to both, it is dumb to this, speaks to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that; yea rather it speaks to all; but they only understand, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">compare its voice received from without, with the truth within. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth saith unto me, “Neither heaven, nor earth, nor any other body is</p>
<p class="calibre1">thy God.” This, their very nature saith to him that seeth them:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“They are a mass; a mass is less in a part thereof than in the whole.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now to thee I speak, O my soul, thou art my better part: for thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickenest the mass of my body, giving it life, which no body can give</p>
<p class="calibre1">to a body: but thy God is even unto thee the Life of thy life.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then do I love, when I love my God? who is He above the head of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my soul? By my very soul will I ascend to Him. I will pass beyond that</p>
<p class="calibre1">power whereby I am united to my body, and fill its whole frame with</p>
<p class="calibre1">life. Nor can I by that power find my God; for so horse and mule</p>
<p class="calibre1">that have no understanding might find Him; seeing it is the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">power, whereby even their bodies live. But another power there is, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">that only whereby I animate, but that too whereby I imbue with sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">my flesh, which the Lord hath framed for me: commanding the eye not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear, and the ear not to see; but the eye, that through it I should</p>
<p class="calibre1">see, and the ear, that through it I should hear; and to the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">senses severally, what is to each their own peculiar seats and</p>
<p class="calibre1">offices; which, being divers, I the one mind, do through them enact. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">will pass beyond this power of mine also; for this also have the</p>
<p class="calibre1">horse, and mule, for they also perceive through the body.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I will pass then beyond this power of my nature also, rising by</p>
<p class="calibre1">degrees unto Him Who made me. And I come to the fields and spacious</p>
<p class="calibre1">palaces of my memory, where are the treasures of innumerable images,</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought into it from things of all sorts perceived by the senses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is stored up, whatsoever besides we think, either by enlarging</p>
<p class="calibre1">or diminishing, or any other way varying those things which the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense hath come to; and whatever else hath been committed and laid up,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which forgetfulness hath not yet swallowed up and buried. When I enter</p>
<p class="calibre1">there, I require what I will to be brought forth, and something</p>
<p class="calibre1">instantly comes; others must be longer sought after, which are</p>
<p class="calibre1">fetched, as it were, out of some inner receptacle; others rush out</p>
<p class="calibre1">in troops, and while one thing is desired and required, they start</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth, as who should say, “Is it perchance I?” These I drive away with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hand of my heart, from the face of my remembrance; until what I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wish for be unveiled, and appear in sight, out of its secret place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other things come up readily, in unbroken order, as they are called</p>
<p class="calibre1">for; those in front making way for the following; and as they make</p>
<p class="calibre1">way, they are hidden from sight, ready to come when I will. All</p>
<p class="calibre1">which takes place when I repeat a thing by heart.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are all things preserved distinctly and under general heads,</p>
<p class="calibre1">each having entered by its own avenue: as light, and all colours and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms of bodies by the eyes; by the ears all sorts of sounds; all</p>
<p class="calibre1">smells by the avenue of the nostrils; all tastes by the mouth; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the sensation of the whole body, what is hard or soft; hot or cold;</p>
<p class="calibre1">or rugged; heavy or light; either outwardly or inwardly to the body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All these doth that great harbour of the memory receive in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">numberless secret and inexpressible windings, to be forthcoming, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought out at need; each entering in by his own gate, and there</p>
<p class="calibre1">laid up. Nor yet do the things themselves enter in; only the images of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the things perceived are there in readiness, for thought to recall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Which images, how they are formed, who can tell, though it doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">plainly appear by which sense each hath been brought in and stored up?</p>
<p class="calibre1">For even while I dwell in darkness and silence, in my memory I can</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce colours, if I will, and discern betwixt black and white, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what others I will: nor yet do sounds break in and disturb the image</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn in by my eyes, which I am reviewing, though they also are there,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lying dormant, and laid up, as it were, apart. For these too I call</p>
<p class="calibre1">for, and forthwith they appear. And though my tongue be still, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">my throat mute, so can I sing as much as I will; nor do those images</p>
<p class="calibre1">of colours, which notwithstanding be there, intrude themselves and</p>
<p class="calibre1">interrupt, when another store is called for, which flowed in by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears. So the other things, piled in and up by the other senses, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">recall at my pleasure. Yea, I discern the breath of lilies from</p>
<p class="calibre1">violets, though smelling nothing; and I prefer honey to sweet wine,</p>
<p class="calibre1">smooth before rugged, at the time neither tasting nor handling, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembering only.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">These things do I within, in that vast court of my memory. For there</p>
<p class="calibre1">are present with me, heaven, earth, sea, and whatever I could think on</p>
<p class="calibre1">therein, besides what I have forgotten. There also meet I with myself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and recall myself, and when, where, and what I have done, and under</p>
<p class="calibre1">what feelings. There be all which I remember, either on my own</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience, or other’s credit. Out of the same store do I myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the past continually combine fresh and fresh likenesses of things</p>
<p class="calibre1">which I have experienced, or, from what I have experienced, have</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed: and thence again infer future actions, events and hopes, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">all these again I reflect on, as present. “I will do this or that,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">say I to myself, in that great receptacle of my mind, stored with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the images of things so many and so great, “and this or that will</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow.” “O that this or that might be!” “God avert this or that!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">So speak I to myself: and when I speak, the images of all I speak of</p>
<p class="calibre1">are present, out of the same treasury of memory; nor would I speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">of any thereof, were the images wanting.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great is this force of memory, excessive great, O my God; a large</p>
<p class="calibre1">and boundless chamber! who ever sounded the bottom thereof? yet is</p>
<p class="calibre1">this a power of mine, and belongs unto my nature; nor do I myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehend all that I am. Therefore is the mind too strait to</p>
<p class="calibre1">contain itself. And where should that be, which it containeth not of</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself? Is it without it, and not within? how then doth it not</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehend itself? A wonderful admiration surprises me, amazement</p>
<p class="calibre1">seizes me upon this. And men go abroad to admire the heights of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mountains, the mighty billows of the sea, the broad tides of rivers,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the compass of the ocean, and the circuits of the stars, and pass</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves by; nor wonder that when I spake of all these things, I did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not see them with mine eyes, yet could not have spoken of them, unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">I then actually saw the mountains, billows, rivers, stars which I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had seen, and that ocean which I believe to be, inwardly in my memory,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that, with the same vast spaces between, as if I saw them</p>
<p class="calibre1">abroad. Yet did not I by seeing draw them into myself, when with</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine eyes I beheld them; nor are they themselves with me, but their</p>
<p class="calibre1">images only. And I know by what sense of the body each was impressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet not these alone does the unmeasurable capacity of my memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">retain. Here also is all, learnt of the liberal sciences and as yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">unforgotten; removed as it were to some inner place, which is yet no</p>
<p class="calibre1">place: nor are they the images thereof, but the things themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For, what is literature, what the art of disputing, how many kinds</p>
<p class="calibre1">of questions there be, whatsoever of these I know, in such manner</p>
<p class="calibre1">exists in my memory, as that I have not taken in the image, and left</p>
<p class="calibre1">out the thing, or that it should have sounded and passed away like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice fixed on the ear by that impress, whereby it might be</p>
<p class="calibre1">recalled, as if it sounded, when it no longer sounded; or as a smell</p>
<p class="calibre1">while it passes and evaporates into air affects the sense of smell,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whence it conveys into the memory an image of itself, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembering, we renew, or as meat, which verily in the belly hath</p>
<p class="calibre1">now no taste, and yet in the memory still in a manner tasteth; or as</p>
<p class="calibre1">any thing which the body by touch perceiveth, and which when removed</p>
<p class="calibre1">from us, the memory still conceives. For those things are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmitted into the memory, but their images only are with an</p>
<p class="calibre1">admirable swiftness caught up, and stored as it were in wondrous</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabinets, and thence wonderfully by the act of remembering, brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now when I hear that there be three kinds of questions, “Whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">the thing be? what it is? of what kind it is? I do indeed hold the</p>
<p class="calibre1">images of the sounds of which those words be composed, and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">those sounds, with a noise passed through the air, and now are not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the things themselves which are signified by those sounds, I never</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached with any sense of my body, nor ever discerned them otherwise</p>
<p class="calibre1">than in my mind; yet in my memory have I laid up not their images, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves. Which how they entered into me, let them say if they</p>
<p class="calibre1">can; for I have gone over all the avenues of my flesh, but cannot find</p>
<p class="calibre1">by which they entered. For the eyes say, “If those images were</p>
<p class="calibre1">coloured, we reported of them.” The ears say, “If they sound, we</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave knowledge of them.” The nostrils say, “If they smell, they passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by us.” The taste says, “Unless they have a savour, ask me not.” The</p>
<p class="calibre1">touch says, “If it have not size, I handled it not; if I handled it</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, I gave no notice of it.” Whence and how entered these things into</p>
<p class="calibre1">my memory? I know not how. For when I learned them, I gave not</p>
<p class="calibre1">credit to another man’s mind, but recognised them in mine; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">approving them for true, I commended them to it, laying them up as</p>
<p class="calibre1">it were, whence I might bring them forth when I willed. In my heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">then they were, even before I learned them, but in my memory they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">not. Where then? or wherefore, when they were spoken, did I</p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledge them, and said, “So is it, it is true,” unless that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were already in the memory, but so thrown back and buried as it were</p>
<p class="calibre1">in deeper recesses, that had not the suggestion of another drawn</p>
<p class="calibre1">them forth I had perchance been unable to conceive of them?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wherefore we find, that to learn these things whereof we imbibe</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor the images by our senses, but perceive within by themselves,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without images, as they are, is nothing else, but by conception, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">receive, and by marking to take heed that those things which the</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory did before contain at random and unarranged, be laid up at hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">as it were in that same memory where before they lay unknown,</p>
<p class="calibre1">scattered and neglected, and so readily occur to the mind familiarised</p>
<p class="calibre1">to them. And how many things of this kind does my memory bear which</p>
<p class="calibre1">have been already found out, and as I said, placed as it were at hand,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which we are said to have learned and come to know which were I for</p>
<p class="calibre1">some short space of time to cease to call to mind, they are again so</p>
<p class="calibre1">buried, and glide back, as it were, into the deeper recesses, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they must again, as if new, he thought out thence, for other abode</p>
<p class="calibre1">they have none: but they must be drawn together again, that they may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be known; that is to say, they must as it were be collected together</p>
<p class="calibre1">from their dispersion: whence the word “cogitation” is derived. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">cogo (collect) and cogito (recollect) have the same relation to</p>
<p class="calibre1">each other as ago and agito, facio and factito. But the mind hath</p>
<p class="calibre1">appropriated to itself this word (cogitation), so that, not what is</p>
<p class="calibre1">“collected” any how, but what is “recollected,” i.e., brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, in the mind, is properly said to be cogitated, or thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The memory containeth also reasons and laws innumerable of numbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">and dimensions, none of which hath any bodily sense impressed;</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing they have neither colour, nor sound, nor taste, nor smell,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor touch. I have heard the sound of the words whereby when</p>
<p class="calibre1">discussed they are denoted: but the sounds are other than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">things. For the sounds are other in Greek than in Latin; but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">things are neither Greek, nor Latin, nor any other language. I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen the lines of architects, the very finest, like a spider’s thread;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but those are still different, they are not the images of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines which the eye of flesh showed me: he knoweth them, whosoever</p>
<p class="calibre1">without any conception whatsoever of a body, recognises them within</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself. I have perceived also the numbers of the things with which we</p>
<p class="calibre1">number all the senses of my body; but those numbers wherewith we</p>
<p class="calibre1">number are different, nor are they the images of these, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore they indeed are. Let him who seeth them not, deride me for</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying these things, and I will pity him, while he derides me.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">All these things I remember, and how I learnt them I remember.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many things also most falsely objected against them have I heard,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and remember; which though they be false, yet is it not false that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember them; and I remember also that I have discerned betwixt those</p>
<p class="calibre1">truths and these falsehoods objected to them. And I perceive that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the present discerning of these things is different from remembering</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I oftentimes discerned them, when I often thought upon them. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">both remember then to have often understood these things; and what I</p>
<p class="calibre1">now discern and understand, I lay up in my memory, that hereafter I</p>
<p class="calibre1">may remember that I understand it now. So then I remember also to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered; as if hereafter I shall call to remembrance, that I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">now been able to remember these things, by the force of memory shall I</p>
<p class="calibre1">call it to remembrance.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same memory contains also the affections of my mind, not in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same manner that my mind itself contains them, when it feels them;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but far otherwise, according to a power of its own. For without</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejoicing I remember myself to have joyed; and without sorrow do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">recollect my past sorrow. And that I once feared, I review without</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear; and without desire call to mind a past desire. Sometimes, on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrary, with joy do I remember my fore-past sorrow, and with sorrow,</p>
<p class="calibre1">joy. Which is not wonderful, as to the body; for mind is one thing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">body another. If I therefore with joy remember some past pain of body,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is not so wonderful. But now seeing this very memory itself is mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">(for when we give a thing in charge, to be kept in memory, we say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“See that you keep it in mind”; and when we forget, we say, “It did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not come to my mind,” and, “It slipped out of my mind,” calling the</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory itself the mind); this being so, how is it that when with joy I</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember my past sorrow, the mind hath joy, the memory hath sorrow;</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mind upon the joyfulness which is in it, is joyful, yet the memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the sadness which is in it, is not sad? Does the memory perchance</p>
<p class="calibre1">not belong to the mind? Who will say so? The memory then is, as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were, the belly of the mind, and joy and sadness, like sweet and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bitter food; which, when committed to the memory, are as it were</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed into the belly, where they may be stowed, but cannot taste.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ridiculous it is to imagine these to be alike; and yet are they not</p>
<p class="calibre1">utterly unlike.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, behold, out of my memory I bring it, when I say there be four</p>
<p class="calibre1">perturbations of the mind, desire, joy, fear, sorrow; and whatsoever I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can dispute thereon, by dividing each into its subordinate species,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and by defining it, in my memory find I what to say, and thence do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">bring it: yet am I not disturbed by any of these perturbations, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">by calling them to mind, I remember them; yea, and before I recalled</p>
<p class="calibre1">and brought them back, they were there; and therefore could they, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">recollection, thence be brought. Perchance, then, as meat is by</p>
<p class="calibre1">chewing the cud brought up out of the belly, so by recollection</p>
<p class="calibre1">these out of the memory. Why then does not the disputer, thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">recollecting, taste in the mouth of his musing the sweetness of joy,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or the bitterness of sorrow? Is the comparison unlike in this, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">not in all respects like? For who would willingly speak thereof, if so</p>
<p class="calibre1">oft as we name grief or fear, we should be compelled to be sad or</p>
<p class="calibre1">fearful? And yet could we not speak of them, did we not find in our</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory, not only the sounds of the names according to the images</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressed by the senses of the body, but notions of the very things</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves which we never received by any avenue of the body, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">which the mind itself perceiving by the experience of its own</p>
<p class="calibre1">passions, committed to the memory, or the memory of itself retained,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without being committed unto it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But whether by images or no, who can readily say? Thus, I name a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stone, I name the sun, the things themselves not being present to my</p>
<p class="calibre1">senses, but their images to my memory. I name a bodily pain, yet it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not present with me, when nothing aches: yet unless its image were</p>
<p class="calibre1">present to my memory, I should not know what to say thereof, nor in</p>
<p class="calibre1">discoursing discern pain from pleasure. I name bodily health; being</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound in body, the thing itself is present with me; yet, unless its</p>
<p class="calibre1">image also were present in my memory, I could by no means recall</p>
<p class="calibre1">what the sound of this name should signify. Nor would the sick, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">health were named, recognise what were spoken, unless the same image</p>
<p class="calibre1">were by the force of memory retained, although the thing itself were</p>
<p class="calibre1">absent from the body. I name numbers whereby we number; and not</p>
<p class="calibre1">their images, but themselves are present in my memory. I name the</p>
<p class="calibre1">image of the sun, and that image is present in my memory. For I recall</p>
<p class="calibre1">not the image of its image, but the image itself is present to me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling it to mind. I name memory, and I recognise what I name. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">where do I recognise it, but in the memory itself? Is it also</p>
<p class="calibre1">present to itself by its image, and not by itself?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What, when I name forgetfulness, and withal recognise what I name?</p>
<p class="calibre1">whence should I recognise it, did I not remember it? I speak not of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sound of the name, but of the thing which it signifies: which if I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had forgotten, I could not recognise what that sound signifies. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">then I remember memory, memory itself is, through itself, present with</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself: but when I remember forgetfulness, there are present both</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory and forgetfulness; memory whereby I remember, forgetfulness</p>
<p class="calibre1">which I remember. But what is forgetfulness, but the privation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory? How then is it present that I remember it, since when</p>
<p class="calibre1">present I cannot remember? But if what we remember we hold it in</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory, yet, unless we did remember forgetfulness, we could never at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hearing of the name recognise the thing thereby signified, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgetfulness is retained by memory. Present then it is, that we</p>
<p class="calibre1">forget not, and being so, we forget. It is to be understood from</p>
<p class="calibre1">this that forgetfulness when we remember it, is not present to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory by itself but by its image: because if it were present by</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself, it would not cause us to remember, but to forget. Who now</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall search out this? who shall comprehend how it is?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, I, truly, toil therein, yea and toil in myself; I am become</p>
<p class="calibre1">a heavy soil requiring over much sweat of the brow. For we are not now</p>
<p class="calibre1">searching out the regions of heaven, or measuring the distances of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stars, or enquiring the balancings of the earth. It is I myself who</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember, I the mind. It is not so wonderful, if what I myself am not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">be far from me. But what is nearer to me than myself? And to, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">force of mine own memory is not understood by me; though I cannot so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much as name myself without it. For what shall I say, when it is clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">to me that I remember forgetfulness? Shall I say that that is not in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my memory, which I remember? or shall I say that forgetfulness is</p>
<p class="calibre1">for this purpose in my memory, that I might not forget? Both were most</p>
<p class="calibre1">absurd. What third way is there? How can I say that the image of</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgetfulness is retained by my memory, not forgetfulness itself, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember it? How could I say this either, seeing that when the image</p>
<p class="calibre1">of any thing is impressed on the memory, the thing itself must needs</p>
<p class="calibre1">be first present, whence that image may be impressed? For thus do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember Carthage, thus all places where I have been, thus men’s faces</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom I have seen, and things reported by the other senses; thus the</p>
<p class="calibre1">health or sickness of the body. For when these things were present, my</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory received from them images, which being present with me, I might</p>
<p class="calibre1">look on and bring back in my mind, when I remembered them in their</p>
<p class="calibre1">absence. If then this forgetfulness is retained in the memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">through its image, not through itself, then plainly itself was once</p>
<p class="calibre1">present, that its image might be taken. But when it was present, how</p>
<p class="calibre1">did it write its image in the memory, seeing that forgetfulness by its</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence effaces even what it finds already noted? And yet, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever way, although that way be past conceiving and explaining, yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain am I that I remember forgetfulness itself also, whereby what</p>
<p class="calibre1">we remember is effaced.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great is the power of memory, a fearful thing, O my God, a deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">and boundless manifoldness; and this thing is the mind, and this am</p>
<p class="calibre1">I myself. What am I then, O my God? What nature am I? A life various</p>
<p class="calibre1">and manifold, and exceeding immense. Behold in the plains, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">caves, and caverns of my memory, innumerable and innumerably full of</p>
<p class="calibre1">innumerable kinds of things, either through images, as all bodies;</p>
<p class="calibre1">or by actual presence, as the arts; or by certain notions or</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressions, as the affections of the mind, which, even when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind doth not feel, the memory retaineth, while yet whatsoever is in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the memory is also in the mind-over all these do I run, I fly; I dive</p>
<p class="calibre1">on this side and on that, as far as I can, and there is no end. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">great is the force of memory, so great the force of life, even in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mortal life of man. What shall I do then, O Thou my true life,</p>
<p class="calibre1">my God? I will pass even beyond this power of mine which is called</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory: yea, I will pass beyond it, that I may approach unto Thee, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweet Light. What sayest Thou to me? See, I am mounting up through</p>
<p class="calibre1">my mind towards Thee who abidest above me. Yea, I now will pass beyond</p>
<p class="calibre1">this power of mine which is called memory, desirous to arrive at Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whence Thou mayest be arrived at; and to cleave unto Thee, whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">one may cleave unto Thee. For even beasts and birds have memory;</p>
<p class="calibre1">else could they not return to their dens and nests, nor many other</p>
<p class="calibre1">things they are used unto: nor indeed could they be used to any thing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but by memory. I will pass then beyond memory also, that I may</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrive at Him who hath separated me from the four-footed beasts and</p>
<p class="calibre1">made me wiser than the fowls of the air, I will pass beyond memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">also, and where shall I find Thee, Thou truly good and certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweetness? And where shall I find Thee? If I find Thee without my</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory, then do I not retain Thee in my memory. And how shall I find</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, if I remember Thee not?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the woman that had lost her groat, and sought it with a light;</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless she had remembered it, she had never found it. For when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was found, whence should she know whether it were the same, unless she</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered it? I remember to have sought and found many a thing; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">this I thereby know, that when I was seeking any of them, and was</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked, “Is this it?” “Is that it?” so long said I “No,” until that</p>
<p class="calibre1">were offered me which I sought. Which had I not remembered (whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">it were) though it were offered me, yet should I not find it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because I could not recognise it. And so it ever is, when we seek</p>
<p class="calibre1">and find any lost thing. Notwithstanding, when any thing is by</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance lost from the sight, not from the memory (as any visible body),</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet its image is still retained within, and it is sought until it be</p>
<p class="calibre1">restored to sight; and when it is found, it is recognised by the image</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is within: nor do we say that we have found what was lost,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless we recognise it; nor can we recognise it, unless we remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. But this was lost to the eyes, but retained in the memory.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what when the memory itself loses any thing, as falls out when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we forget and seek that we may recollect? Where in the end do we</p>
<p class="calibre1">search, but in the memory itself? and there, if one thing be perchance</p>
<p class="calibre1">offered instead of another, we reject it, until what we seek meets us;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and when it doth, we say, “This is it”; which we should not unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">we recognised it, nor recognise it unless we remembered it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly then we had forgotten it. Or, had not the whole escaped</p>
<p class="calibre1">us, but by the part whereof we had hold, was the lost part sought for;</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that the memory felt that it did not carry on together all which it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was wont, and maimed, as it were, by the curtailment of its ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">habit, demanded the restoration of what it missed? For instance, if we</p>
<p class="calibre1">see or think of some one known to us, and having forgotten his name,</p>
<p class="calibre1">try to recover it; whatever else occurs, connects itself not</p>
<p class="calibre1">therewith; because it was not wont to be thought upon together with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, and therefore is rejected, until that present itself, whereon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge reposes equably as its wonted object. And whence does that</p>
<p class="calibre1">present itself, but out of the memory itself? for even when we</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognise it, on being reminded by another, it is thence it comes. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">we do not believe it as something new, but, upon recollection, allow</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was named to be right. But were it utterly blotted out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind, we should not remember it, even when reminded. For we have not</p>
<p class="calibre1">as yet utterly forgotten that, which we remember ourselves to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten. What then we have utterly forgotten, though lost, we cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">even seek after.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">How then do I seek Thee, O Lord? For when I seek Thee, my God, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">seek a happy life. I will seek Thee, that my soul may live. For my</p>
<p class="calibre1">body liveth by my soul; and my soul by Thee. How then do I seek a</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy life, seeing I have it not, until I can say, where I ought to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say it, “It is enough”? How seek I it? By remembrance, as though I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten it, remembering that I had forgotten it? Or, desiring to</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn it as a thing unknown, either never having known, or so</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten it, as not even to remember that I had forgotten it? is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not a happy life what all will, and no one altogether wills it not?</p>
<p class="calibre1">where have they known it, that they so will it? where seen it, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they so love it? Truly we have it, how, I know not. Yea, there is</p>
<p class="calibre1">another way, wherein when one hath it, then is he happy; and there</p>
<p class="calibre1">are, who are blessed, in hope. These have it in a lower kind, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">they who have it in very deed; yet are they better off than such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">are happy neither in deed nor in hope. Yet even these, had they it not</p>
<p class="calibre1">in some sort, would not so will to be happy, which that they do</p>
<p class="calibre1">will, is most certain. They have known it then, I know not how, and so</p>
<p class="calibre1">have it by some sort of knowledge, what, I know not, and am</p>
<p class="calibre1">perplexed whether it be in the memory, which if it be, then we have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been happy once; whether all severally, or in that man who first</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinned, in whom also we all died, and from whom we are all born with</p>
<p class="calibre1">misery, I now enquire not; but only, whether the happy life be in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the memory? For neither should we love it, did we not know it. We hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">the name, and we all confess that we desire the thing; for we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not delighted with the mere sound. For when a Greek hears it in Latin,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he is not delighted, not knowing what is spoken; but we Latins are</p>
<p class="calibre1">delighted, as would he too, if he heard it in Greek; because the thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself is neither Greek nor Latin, which Greeks and Latins, and men of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all other tongues, long for so earnestly. Known therefore it is to</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, for they with one voice be asked, “would they be happy?” they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would answer without doubt, “they would.” And this could not be,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless the thing itself whereof it is the name were retained in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their memory.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But is it so, as one remembers Carthage who hath seen it? No. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">a happy life is not seen with the eye, because it is not a body. As we</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember numbers then? No. For these, he that hath in his knowledge,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeks not further to attain unto; but a happy life we have in our</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge, and therefore love it, and yet still desire to attain it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we may be happy. As we remember eloquence then? No. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">although upon hearing this name also, some call to mind the thing, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">still are not yet eloquent, and many who desire to be so, whence it</p>
<p class="calibre1">appears that it is in their knowledge; yet these have by their</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodily senses observed others to be eloquent, and been delighted,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and desire to be the like (though indeed they would not be delighted</p>
<p class="calibre1">but for some inward knowledge thereof, nor wish to be the like, unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">they were thus delighted); whereas a happy life, we do by no bodily</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense experience in others. As then we remember joy? Perchance; for my</p>
<p class="calibre1">joy I remember, even when sad, as a happy life, when unhappy; nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">did I ever with bodily sense see, hear, smell, taste, or touch my joy;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but I experienced it in my mind, when I rejoiced; and the knowledge of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it clave to my memory, so that I can recall it with disgust sometimes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">at others with longing, according to the nature of the things, wherein</p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember myself to have joyed. For even from foul things have I been</p>
<p class="calibre1">immersed in a sort of joy; which now recalling, I detest and execrate;</p>
<p class="calibre1">otherwhiles in good and honest things, which I recall with longing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">although perchance no longer present; and therefore with sadness I</p>
<p class="calibre1">recall former joy.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where then and when did I experience my happy life, that I should</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember, and love, and long for it? Nor is it I alone, or some few</p>
<p class="calibre1">besides, but we all would fain be happy; which, unless by some certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge we knew, we should not with so certain a will desire. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">how is this, that if two men be asked whether they would go to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wars, one, perchance, would answer that he would, the other, that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not; but if they were asked whether they would be happy, both</p>
<p class="calibre1">would instantly without any doubting say they would; and for no</p>
<p class="calibre1">other reason would the one go to the wars, and the other not, but to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be happy. Is it perchance that as one looks for his joy in this thing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">another in that, all agree in their desire of being happy, as they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would (if they were asked) that they wished to have joy, and this</p>
<p class="calibre1">joy they call a happy life? Although then one obtains this joy by</p>
<p class="calibre1">one means, another by another, all have one end, which they strive</p>
<p class="calibre1">to attain, namely, joy. Which being a thing which all must say they</p>
<p class="calibre1">have experienced, it is therefore found in the memory, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognised whenever the name of a happy life is mentioned.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far be it, Lord, far be it from the heart of Thy servant who here</p>
<p class="calibre1">confesseth unto Thee, far be it, that, be the joy what it may, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">should therefore think myself happy. For there is a joy which is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">given to the ungodly, but to those who love Thee for Thine own sake,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose joy Thou Thyself art. And this is the happy life, to rejoice</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thee, of Thee, for Thee; this is it, and there is no other. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">they who think there is another, pursue some other and not the true</p>
<p class="calibre1">joy. Yet is not their will turned away from some semblance of joy.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not certain then that all wish to be happy, inasmuch as they</p>
<p class="calibre1">who wish not to joy in Thee, which is the only happy life, do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly desire the happy life. Or do all men desire this, but because</p>
<p class="calibre1">the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh, that they cannot do what they would, they fall upon that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which they can, and are content therewith; because, what they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not able to do, they do not will so strongly as would suffice to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make them able? For I ask any one, had he rather joy in truth, or in</p>
<p class="calibre1">falsehood? They will as little hesitate to say “in the truth,” as to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say “that they desire to be happy,” for a happy life is joy in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth: for this is a joying in Thee, Who art the Truth, O God my</p>
<p class="calibre1">light, health of my countenance, my God. This is the happy life</p>
<p class="calibre1">which all desire; this life which alone is happy, all desire; to joy</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the truth all desire. I have met with many that would deceive;</p>
<p class="calibre1">who would be deceived, no one. Where then did they know this happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">life, save where they know the truth also? For they love it also,</p>
<p class="calibre1">since they would not be deceived. And when they love a happy life,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is no other than joying in the truth, then also do they love the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth; which yet they would not love, were there not some notice of it</p>
<p class="calibre1">in their memory. Why then joy they not in it? why are they not</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy? because they are more strongly taken up with other things which</p>
<p class="calibre1">have more power to make them miserable, than that which they so</p>
<p class="calibre1">faintly remember to make them happy. For there is yet a little light</p>
<p class="calibre1">in men; let them walk, let them walk, that the darkness overtake</p>
<p class="calibre1">them not.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But why doth “truth generate hatred,” and the man of Thine,</p>
<p class="calibre1">preaching the truth, become an enemy to them? whereas a happy life</p>
<p class="calibre1">is loved, which is nothing else but joying in the truth; unless that</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth is in that kind loved, that they who love anything else would</p>
<p class="calibre1">gladly have that which they love to be the truth: and because they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not be deceived, would not be convinced that they are so?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore do they hate the truth for that thing’s sake which they</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved instead of the truth. They love truth when she enlightens,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they hate her when she reproves. For since they would not be deceived,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and would deceive, they love her when she discovers herself unto them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and hate her when she discovers them. Whence she shall so repay</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, that they who would not be made manifest by her, she both</p>
<p class="calibre1">against their will makes manifest, and herself becometh not manifest</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto them. Thus, thus, yea thus doth the mind of man, thus blind and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sick, foul and ill-favoured, wish to be hidden, but that aught</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be hidden from it, it wills not. But the contrary is requited</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, that itself should not be hidden from the Truth; but the Truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">is hid from it. Yet even thus miserable, it had rather joy in truths</p>
<p class="calibre1">than in falsehoods. Happy then will it be, when, no distraction</p>
<p class="calibre1">interposing, it shall joy in that only Truth, by Whom all things are</p>
<p class="calibre1">true.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">See what a space I have gone over in my memory seeking Thee, O Lord;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I have not found Thee, without it. Nor have I found any thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerning Thee, but what I have kept in memory, ever since I learnt</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. For since I learnt Thee, I have not forgotten Thee. For where</p>
<p class="calibre1">I found Truth, there found I my God, the Truth itself; which since I</p>
<p class="calibre1">learnt, I have not forgotten. Since then I learnt Thee, Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">residest in my memory; and there do I find Thee, when I call Thee to</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembrance, and delight in Thee. These be my holy delights, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast given me in Thy mercy, having regard to my poverty.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But where in my memory residest Thou, O Lord, where residest Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">there? what manner of lodging hast Thou framed for Thee? what manner</p>
<p class="calibre1">of sanctuary hast Thou builded for Thee? Thou hast given this honour</p>
<p class="calibre1">to my memory, to reside in it; but in what quarter of it Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">residest, that am I considering. For in thinking on Thee, I passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond such parts of it as the beasts also have, for I found Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">not there among the images of corporeal things: and I came to those</p>
<p class="calibre1">parts to which I committed the affections of my mind, nor found Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">there. And I entered into the very seat of my mind (which it hath in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my memory, inasmuch as the mind remembers itself also), neither wert</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou there: for as Thou art not a corporeal image, nor the affection</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a living being (as when we rejoice, condole, desire, fear,</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember, forget, or the like); so neither art Thou the mind itself;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because Thou art the Lord God of the mind; and all these are</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed, but Thou remainest unchangeable over all, and yet hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">vouchsafed to dwell in my memory, since I learnt Thee. And why seek</p>
<p class="calibre1">I now in what place thereof Thou dwellest, as if there were places</p>
<p class="calibre1">therein? Sure I am, that in it Thou dwellest, since I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered Thee ever since I learnt Thee, and there I find Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when I call Thee to remembrance.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where then did I find Thee, that I might learn Thee? For in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory Thou wert not, before I learned Thee. Where then did I find</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, that I might learn Thee, but in Thee above me? Place there is</p>
<p class="calibre1">none; we go backward and forward, and there is no place. Every</p>
<p class="calibre1">where, O Truth, dost Thou give audience to all who ask counsel of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, and at once answerest all, though on manifold matters they ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy counsel. Clearly dost Thou answer, though all do not clearly hear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All consult Thee on what they will, though they hear not always what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they will. He is Thy best servant who looks not so much to hear that</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Thee which himself willeth, as rather to will that, which from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee he heareth.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too late loved I Thee, O Thou Beauty of ancient days, yet ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">new! too late I loved Thee! And behold, Thou wert within, and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">abroad, and there I searched for Thee; deformed I, plunging amid those</p>
<p class="calibre1">fair forms which Thou hadst made. Thou wert with me, but I was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Thee. Things held me far from Thee, which, unless they were in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, were not at all. Thou calledst, and shoutedst, and burstest my</p>
<p class="calibre1">deafness. Thou flashedst, shonest, and scatteredst my blindness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou breathedst odours, and I drew in breath and panted for Thee. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">tasted, and hunger and thirst. Thou touchedst me, and I burned for Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">peace.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I shall with my whole self cleave to Thee, I shall no where</p>
<p class="calibre1">have sorrow or labour; and my life shall wholly live, as wholly full</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thee. But now since whom Thou fillest, Thou liftest up, because I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am not full of Thee I am a burden to myself. Lamentable joys strive</p>
<p class="calibre1">with joyous sorrows: and on which side is the victory, I know not. Woe</p>
<p class="calibre1">is me! Lord, have pity on me. My evil sorrows strive with my good</p>
<p class="calibre1">joys; and on which side is the victory, I know not. Woe is me! Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">have pity on me. Woe is me! lo! I hide not my wounds; Thou art the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Physician, I the sick; Thou merciful, I miserable. Is not the life</p>
<p class="calibre1">of man upon earth all trial? Who wishes for troubles and difficulties?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou commandest them to be endured, not to be loved. No man loves what</p>
<p class="calibre1">he endures, though he love to endure. For though he rejoices that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">endures, he had rather there were nothing for him to endure. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">adversity I long for prosperity, in prosperity I fear adversity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What middle place is there betwixt these two, where the life of man is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not all trial? Woe to the prosperities of the world, once and again,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through fear of adversity, and corruption of joy! Woe to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">adversities of the world, once and again, and the third time, from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">longing for prosperity, and because adversity itself is a hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, and lest it shatter endurance. Is not the life of man upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth all trial: without any interval?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And all my hope is no where but in Thy exceeding great mercy. Give</p>
<p class="calibre1">what Thou enjoinest, and enjoin what Thou wilt. Thou enjoinest us</p>
<p class="calibre1">continency; and when I knew, saith one, that no man can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">continent, unless God give it, this also was a part of wisdom to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know whose gift she is. By continency verily are we bound up and</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought back into One, whence we were dissipated into many. For too</p>
<p class="calibre1">little doth he love Thee, who loves any thing with Thee, which he</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveth not for Thee. O love, who ever burnest and never consumest! O</p>
<p class="calibre1">charity, my God, kindle me. Thou enjoinest continency: give me what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou enjoinest, and enjoin what Thou wilt.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Verily Thou enjoinest me continency from the lust of the flesh,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the lust of the eyes, and the ambition of the world. Thou enjoinest</p>
<p class="calibre1">continency from concubinage; and for wedlock itself, Thou hast</p>
<p class="calibre1">counselled something better than what Thou hast permitted. And since</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou gavest it, it was done, even before I became a dispenser of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sacrament. But there yet live in my memory (whereof I have much</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoken) the images of such things as my ill custom there fixed;</p>
<p class="calibre1">which haunt me, strengthless when I am awake: but in sleep, not only</p>
<p class="calibre1">so as to give pleasure, but even to obtain assent, and what is very</p>
<p class="calibre1">like reality. Yea, so far prevails the illusion of the image, in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul and in my flesh, that, when asleep, false visions persuade to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that which when waking, the true cannot. Am I not then myself, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord my God? And yet there is so much difference betwixt myself and</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself, within that moment wherein I pass from waking to sleeping,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or return from sleeping to waking! Where is reason then, which, awake,</p>
<p class="calibre1">resisteth such suggestions? And should the things themselves be</p>
<p class="calibre1">urged on it, it remaineth unshaken. Is it clasped up with the eyes? is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it lulled asleep with the senses of the body? And whence is it that</p>
<p class="calibre1">often even in sleep we resist, and mindful of our purpose, and abiding</p>
<p class="calibre1">most chastely in it, yield no assent to such enticements? And yet so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much difference there is, that when it happeneth otherwise, upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">waking we return to peace of conscience: and by this very difference</p>
<p class="calibre1">discover that we did not, what yet we be sorry that in some way it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">done in us.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Art Thou not mighty, God Almighty, so as to heal all the diseases of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my soul, and by Thy more abundant grace to quench even the impure</p>
<p class="calibre1">motions of my sleep! Thou wilt increase, Lord, Thy gifts more and more</p>
<p class="calibre1">in me, that my soul may follow me to Thee, disentangled from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">birdlime of concupiscence; that it rebel not against itself, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">even in dreams not only not, through images of sense, commit those</p>
<p class="calibre1">debasing corruptions, even to pollution of the flesh, but not even</p>
<p class="calibre1">to consent unto them. For that nothing of this sort should have,</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the pure affections even of a sleeper, the very least</p>
<p class="calibre1">influence, not even such as a thought would restrain, -to work this,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not only during life, but even at my present age, is not hard for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Almighty, Who art able to do above all that we ask or think. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I yet am in this kind of my evil, have I confessed unto my good</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord; rejoicing with trembling, in that which Thou hast given me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and bemoaning that wherein I am still imperfect; hoping that Thou wilt</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfect Thy mercies in me, even to perfect peace, which my outward and</p>
<p class="calibre1">inward man shall have with Thee, when death shall be swallowed up in</p>
<p class="calibre1">victory.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is another evil of the day, which I would were sufficient</p>
<p class="calibre1">for it. For by eating and drinking we repair the daily decays of our</p>
<p class="calibre1">body, until Thou destroy both belly and meat, when Thou shalt slay</p>
<p class="calibre1">my emptiness with a wonderful fulness, and clothe this incorruptible</p>
<p class="calibre1">with an eternal incorruption. But now the necessity is sweet unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, against which sweetness I fight, that I be not taken captive;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and carry on a daily war by fastings; often bringing my body into</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjection; and my pains are removed by pleasure. For hunger and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirst are in a manner pains; they burn and kill like a fever,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless the medicine of nourishments come to our aid. Which since it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">at hand through the consolations of Thy gifts, with which land, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">water, and air serve our weakness, our calamity is termed</p>
<p class="calibre1">gratification.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This hast Thou taught me, that I should set myself to take food as</p>
<p class="calibre1">physic. But while I am passing from the discomfort of emptiness to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">content of replenishing, in the very passage the snare of</p>
<p class="calibre1">concupiscence besets me. For that passing, is pleasure, nor is there</p>
<p class="calibre1">any other way to pass thither, whither we needs must pass. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">health being the cause of eating and drinking, there joineth itself as</p>
<p class="calibre1">an attendant a dangerous pleasure, which mostly endeavours to go</p>
<p class="calibre1">before it, so that I may for her sake do what I say I do, or wish to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do, for health’s sake. Nor have each the same measure; for what is</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough for health, is too little for pleasure. And oft it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncertain, whether it be the necessary care of the body which is yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking for sustenance, or whether a voluptuous deceivableness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">greediness is proffering its services. In this uncertainty the unhappy</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul rejoiceth, and therein prepares an excuse to shield itself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">glad that it appeareth not what sufficeth for the moderation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">health, that under the cloak of health, it may disguise the matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of gratification. These temptations I daily endeavour to resist, and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">call on Thy right hand, and to Thee do I refer my perplexities;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because I have as yet no settled counsel herein.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hear the voice of my God commanding, Let not your hearts be</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness. Drunkenness is far from</p>
<p class="calibre1">me; Thou wilt have mercy, that it come not near me. But full feeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes creepeth upon Thy servant; Thou wilt have mercy, that it may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be far from me. For no one can be continent unless Thou give it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many things Thou givest us, praying for them; and what good soever</p>
<p class="calibre1">we have received before we prayed, from Thee we received it; yea to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the end we might afterwards know this, did we before receive it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drunkard was I never, but drunkards have I known made sober by Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;From Thee then it was, that they who never were such, should not so</p>
<p class="calibre1">be, as from Thee it was, that they who have been, should not ever so</p>
<p class="calibre1">be; and from Thee it was, that both might know from Whom it was. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard another voice of Thine, Go not after thy lusts, and from thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure turn away. Yea by Thy favour have I heard that which I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">much loved; neither if we eat, shall we abound; neither if we eat not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall we lack; which is to say, neither shall the one make me</p>
<p class="calibre1">plenteous, nor the other miserable. I heard also another, for I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content; I know</p>
<p class="calibre1">how to abound, and how to suffer need. I can do all things through</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ that strengtheneth me. Behold a soldier of the heavenly camp,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not the dust which we are. But remember, Lord, that we are dust, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that of dust Thou hast made man; and he was lost and is found. Nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">could he of himself do this, because he whom I so loved, saying this</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the in-breathing of Thy inspiration, was of the same dust. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can do all things (saith he) through Him that strengtheneth me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Strengthen me, that I can. Give what Thou enjoinest, and enjoin what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou wilt. He confesses to have received, and when he glorieth, in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord he glorieth. Another have I heard begging that he might</p>
<p class="calibre1">receive. Take from me (saith he) the desires of the belly; whence it</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeareth, O my holy God, that Thou givest, when that is done which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou commandest to be done.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast taught me, good Father, that to the pure, all things are</p>
<p class="calibre1">pure; but that it is evil unto the man that eateth with offence;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and, that every creature of Thine is good, and nothing to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">refused, which is received with thanksgiving; and that meat commendeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">us not to God; and, that no man should judge us in meat or drink; and,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he which eateth, let him not despise him that eateth not; and let</p>
<p class="calibre1">not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth. These things have I</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned, thanks be to Thee, praise to Thee, my God, my Master,</p>
<p class="calibre1">knocking at my ears, enlightening my heart; deliver me out of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">temptation. I fear not uncleanness of meat, but the uncleanness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lusting. I know; that Noah was permitted to eat all kind of flesh that</p>
<p class="calibre1">was good for food; that Elijah was fed with flesh; that endued with an</p>
<p class="calibre1">admirable abstinence, was not polluted by feeding on living creatures,</p>
<p class="calibre1">locusts. I know also that Esau was deceived by lusting for lentiles;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that David blamed himself for desiring a draught of water; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that our King was tempted, not concerning flesh, but bread. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore the people in the wilderness also deserved to be reproved,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not for desiring flesh, but because, in the desire of food, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">murmured against the Lord.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Placed then amid these temptations, I strive daily against</p>
<p class="calibre1">concupiscence in eating and drinking. For it is not of such nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I can settle on cutting it off once for all, and never touching</p>
<p class="calibre1">it afterward, as I could of concubinage. The bridle of the throat then</p>
<p class="calibre1">is to be held attempered between slackness and stiffness. And who is</p>
<p class="calibre1">he, O Lord, who is not some whit transported beyond the limits of</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessity? whoever he is, he is a great one; let him make Thy Name</p>
<p class="calibre1">great. But I am not such, for I am a sinful man. Yet do I too</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnify Thy name; and He maketh intercession to Thee for my sins who</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath overcome the world; numbering me among the weak members of His</p>
<p class="calibre1">body; because Thine eyes have seen that of Him which is imperfect, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Thy book shall all be written.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the allurements of smells, I am not much concerned. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">absent, I do not miss them; when present, I do not refuse them; yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever ready to be without them. So I seem to myself; perchance I am</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceived. For that also is a mournful darkness whereby my abilities</p>
<p class="calibre1">within me are hidden from me; so that my mind making enquiry into</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself of her own powers, ventures not readily to believe herself;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because even what is in it is mostly hidden, unless experience</p>
<p class="calibre1">reveal it. And no one ought to be secure in that life, the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereof is called a trial, that he who hath been capable of worse to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be made better, may not likewise of better be made worse. Our only</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope, only confidence, only assured promise is Thy mercy.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The delights of the ear had more firmly entangled and subdued me;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but Thou didst loosen and free me. Now, in those melodies which Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">words breathe soul into, when sung with a sweet and attuned voice, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do a little repose; yet not so as to be held thereby, but that I can</p>
<p class="calibre1">disengage myself when I will. But with the words which are their</p>
<p class="calibre1">life and whereby they find admission into me, themselves seek in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">affections a place of some estimation, and I can scarcely assign</p>
<p class="calibre1">them one suitable. For at one time I seem to myself to give them</p>
<p class="calibre1">more honour than is seemly, feeling our minds to be more holily and</p>
<p class="calibre1">fervently raised unto a flame of devotion, by the holy words</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves when thus sung, than when not; and that the several</p>
<p class="calibre1">affections of our spirit, by a sweet variety, have their own proper</p>
<p class="calibre1">measures in the voice and singing, by some hidden correspondence</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherewith they are stirred up. But this contentment of the flesh, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">which the soul must not be given over to be enervated, doth oft</p>
<p class="calibre1">beguile me, the sense not so waiting upon reason as patiently to</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow her; but having been admitted merely for her sake, it strives</p>
<p class="calibre1">even to run before her, and lead her. Thus in these things I</p>
<p class="calibre1">unawares sin, but afterwards am aware of it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">At other times, shunning over-anxiously this very deception, I err</p>
<p class="calibre1">in too great strictness; and sometimes to that degree, as to wish</p>
<p class="calibre1">the whole melody of sweet music which is used to David’s Psalter,</p>
<p class="calibre1">banished from my ears, and the Church’s too; and that mode seems to me</p>
<p class="calibre1">safer, which I remember to have been often told me of Athanasius,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bishop of Alexandria, who made the reader of the psalm utter it with</p>
<p class="calibre1">so slight inflection of voice, that it was nearer speaking than</p>
<p class="calibre1">singing. Yet again, when I remember the tears I shed at the Psalmody</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thy Church, in the beginning of my recovered faith; and how at this</p>
<p class="calibre1">time I am moved, not with the singing, but with the things sung,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when they are sung with a clear voice and modulation most suitable,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I acknowledge the great use of this institution. Thus I fluctuate</p>
<p class="calibre1">between peril of pleasure and approved wholesomeness; inclined the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather (though not as pronouncing an irrevocable opinion) to approve</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the usage of singing in the church; that so by the delight of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears the weaker minds may rise to the feeling of devotion. Yet when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">befalls me to be more moved with the voice than the words sung, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess to have sinned penally, and then had rather not hear music.</p>
<p class="calibre1">See now my state; weep with me, and weep for me, ye, whoso regulate</p>
<p class="calibre1">your feelings within, as that good action ensues. For you who do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">act, these things touch not you. But Thou, O Lord my God, hearken;</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold, and see, and have mercy and heal me, Thou, in whose presence I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have become a problem to myself; and that is my infirmity.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There remains the pleasure of these eyes of my flesh, on which to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make my confessions in the hearing of the ears of Thy temple, those</p>
<p class="calibre1">brotherly and devout ears; and so to conclude the temptations of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lust of the flesh, which yet assail me, groaning earnestly, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">desiring to be clothed upon with my house from heaven. The eyes love</p>
<p class="calibre1">fair and varied forms, and bright and soft colours. Let not these</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupy my soul; let God rather occupy it, who made these things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">very good indeed, yet is He my good, not they. And these affect me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">waking, the whole day, nor is any rest given me from them, as there is</p>
<p class="calibre1">from musical, sometimes in silence, from all voices. For this queen of</p>
<p class="calibre1">colours, the light, bathing all which we behold, wherever I am through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the day, gliding by me in varied forms, soothes me when engaged on</p>
<p class="calibre1">other things, and not observing it. And so strongly doth it entwine</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself, that if it be suddenly withdrawn, it is with longing sought</p>
<p class="calibre1">for, and if absent long, saddeneth the mind.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O Thou Light, which Tobias saw, when, these eyes closed, he taught</p>
<p class="calibre1">his son the way of life; and himself went before with the feet of</p>
<p class="calibre1">charity, never swerving. Or which Isaac saw, when his fleshly eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">being heavy and closed by old age, it was vouchsafed him, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowingly, to bless his sons, but by blessing to know them. Or which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jacob saw, when he also, blind through great age, with illumined</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, in the persons of his sons shed light on the different races of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the future people, in them foresignified; and laid his hands,</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystically crossed, upon his grandchildren by Joseph, not as their</p>
<p class="calibre1">father by his outward eye corrected them, but as himself inwardly</p>
<p class="calibre1">discerned. This is the light, it is one, and all are one, who see</p>
<p class="calibre1">and love it. But that corporeal light whereof I spake, it seasoneth</p>
<p class="calibre1">the life of this world for her blind lovers, with an enticing and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous sweetness. But they who know how to praise Thee for it, “O</p>
<p class="calibre1">all-creating Lord,” take it up in Thy hymns, and are not taken up with</p>
<p class="calibre1">it in their sleep. Such would I be. These seductions of the eyes I</p>
<p class="calibre1">resist, lest my feet wherewith I walk upon Thy way be ensnared; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I lift up mine invisible eyes to Thee, that Thou wouldest pluck my</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet out of the snare. Thou dost ever and anon pluck them out, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">they are ensnared. Thou ceasest not to pluck them out, while I often</p>
<p class="calibre1">entangle myself in the snares on all sides laid; because Thou that</p>
<p class="calibre1">keepest Israel shalt neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What innumerable toys, made by divers arts and manufactures, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">our apparel, shoes, utensils and all sorts of works, in pictures</p>
<p class="calibre1">also and divers images, and these far exceeding all necessary and</p>
<p class="calibre1">moderate use and all pious meaning, have men added to tempt their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own eyes withal; outwardly following what themselves make, inwardly</p>
<p class="calibre1">forsaking Him by whom themselves were made, and destroying that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which themselves have been made! But I, my God and my Glory, do</p>
<p class="calibre1">hence also sing a hymn to Thee, and do consecrate praise to Him who</p>
<p class="calibre1">consecrateth me, because those beautiful patterns which through</p>
<p class="calibre1">men’s souls are conveyed into their cunning hands, come from that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beauty, which is above our souls, which my soul day and night</p>
<p class="calibre1">sigheth after. But the framers and followers of the outward beauties</p>
<p class="calibre1">derive thence the rule of judging of them, but not of using them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And He is there, though they perceive Him not, that so they might</p>
<p class="calibre1">not wander, but keep their strength for Thee, and not scatter it</p>
<p class="calibre1">abroad upon pleasurable weariness. And I, though I speak and see this,</p>
<p class="calibre1">entangle my steps with these outward beauties; but Thou pluckest me</p>
<p class="calibre1">out, O Lord, Thou pluckest me out; because Thy loving-kindness is</p>
<p class="calibre1">before my eyes. For I am taken miserably, and Thou pluckest me out</p>
<p class="calibre1">mercifully; sometimes not perceiving it, when I had but lightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">lighted upon them; otherwhiles with pain, because I had stuck fast</p>
<p class="calibre1">in them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">To this is added another form of temptation more manifoldly</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous. For besides that concupiscence of the flesh which</p>
<p class="calibre1">consisteth in the delight of all senses and pleasures, wherein its</p>
<p class="calibre1">slaves, who go far from Thee, waste and perish, the soul hath, through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same senses of the body, a certain vain and curious desire, veiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the title of knowledge and learning, not of delighting in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh, but of making experiments through the flesh. The seat whereof</p>
<p class="calibre1">being in the appetite of knowledge, and sight being the sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">chiefly used for attaining knowledge, it is in Divine language</p>
<p class="calibre1">called The lust of the eyes. For, to see, belongeth properly to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes; yet we use this word of the other senses also, when we employ</p>
<p class="calibre1">them in seeking knowledge. For we do not say, hark how it flashes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or smell how it glows, or taste how it shines, or feel how it</p>
<p class="calibre1">gleams; for all these are said to be seen. And yet we say not only,</p>
<p class="calibre1">see how it shineth, which the eyes alone can perceive; but also, see</p>
<p class="calibre1">how it soundeth, see how it smelleth, see how it tasteth, see how hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is. And so the general experience of the senses, as was said, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">called The lust of the eyes, because the office of seeing, wherein the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes hold the prerogative, the other senses by way of similitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">take to themselves, when they make search after any knowledge.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But by this may more evidently be discerned, wherein pleasure and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherein curiosity is the object of the senses; for pleasure seeketh</p>
<p class="calibre1">objects beautiful, melodious, fragrant, savoury, soft; but</p>
<p class="calibre1">curiosity, for trial’s sake, the contrary as well, not for the sake of</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering annoyance, but out of the lust of making trial and knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. For what pleasure hath it, to see in a mangled carcase what will</p>
<p class="calibre1">make you shudder? and yet if it be lying near, they flock thither,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be made sad, and to turn pale. Even in sleep they are afraid to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. As if when awake, any one forced them to see it, or any report</p>
<p class="calibre1">of its beauty drew them thither! Thus also in the other senses,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which it were long to go through. From this disease of curiosity are</p>
<p class="calibre1">all those strange sights exhibited in the theatre. Hence men go on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to search out the hidden powers of nature (which is besides our</p>
<p class="calibre1">end), which to know profits not, and wherein men desire nothing but to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know. Hence also, if with that same end of perverted knowledge magical</p>
<p class="calibre1">arts be enquired by. Hence also in religion itself, is God tempted,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when signs and wonders are demanded of Him, not desired for any good</p>
<p class="calibre1">end, but merely to make trial of.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this so vast wilderness, full of snares and dangers, behold</p>
<p class="calibre1">many of them I have cut off, and thrust out of my heart, as Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast given me, O God of my salvation. And yet when dare I say, since</p>
<p class="calibre1">so many things of this kind buzz on all sides about our daily life-when dare I say that nothing of this sort engages my attention, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">causes in me an idle interest? True, the theatres do not now carry</p>
<p class="calibre1">me away, nor care I to know the courses of the stars, nor did my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul ever consult ghosts departed; all sacrilegious mysteries I</p>
<p class="calibre1">detest. From Thee, O Lord my God, to whom I owe humble and</p>
<p class="calibre1">single-hearted service, by what artifices and suggestions doth the</p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy deal with me to desire some sign! But I beseech Thee by our</p>
<p class="calibre1">King, and by our pure and holy country, Jerusalem, that as any</p>
<p class="calibre1">consenting thereto is far from me, so may it ever be further and</p>
<p class="calibre1">further. But when I pray Thee for the salvation of any, my end and</p>
<p class="calibre1">intention is far different. Thou givest and wilt give me to follow</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee willingly, doing what Thou wilt.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding, in how many most petty and contemptible things is</p>
<p class="calibre1">our curiosity daily tempted, and how often we give way, who can</p>
<p class="calibre1">recount? How often do we begin as if we were tolerating people telling</p>
<p class="calibre1">vain stories, lest we offend the weak; then by degrees we take</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest therein! I go not now to the circus to see a dog coursing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hare; but in the field, if passing, that coursing peradventure will</p>
<p class="calibre1">distract me even from some weighty thought, and draw me after it:</p>
<p class="calibre1">not that I turn aside the body of my beast, yet still incline my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind thither. And unless Thou, having made me see my infirmity didst</p>
<p class="calibre1">speedily admonish me either through the sight itself by some</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemplation to rise towards Thee, or altogether to despise and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pass it by, I dully stand fixed therein. What, when sitting at home, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lizard catching flies, or a spider entangling them rushing into her</p>
<p class="calibre1">nets, ofttimes takes my attention? Is the thing different, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">they are but small creatures? I go on from them to praise Thee the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful Creator and Orderer of all, but this does not first draw</p>
<p class="calibre1">my attention. It is one thing to rise quickly, another not to fall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And of such things is my life full; and my one hope is Thy wonderful</p>
<p class="calibre1">great mercy. For when our heart becomes the receptacle of such things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and is overcharged with throngs of this abundant vanity, then are</p>
<p class="calibre1">our prayers also thereby often interrupted and distracted, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whilst in Thy presence we direct the voice of our heart to Thine ears,</p>
<p class="calibre1">this so great concern is broken off by the rushing in of I know not</p>
<p class="calibre1">what idle thoughts. Shall we then account this also among things of</p>
<p class="calibre1">slight concernment, or shall aught bring us back to hope, save Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete mercy, since Thou hast begun to change us?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Thou knowest how far Thou hast already changed me, who first</p>
<p class="calibre1">healedst me of the lust of vindicating myself, that so Thou mightest</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgive all the rest of my iniquities, and heal all my infirmities,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and redeem life from corruption, and crown me with mercy and pity, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfy my desire with good things: who didst curb my pride with Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear, and tame my neck to Thy yoke. And now I bear it and it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">light unto me, because so hast Thou promised, and hast made it; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">verily so it was, and I knew it not, when I feared to take it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, O Lord, Thou alone Lord without pride, because Thou art the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only true Lord, who hast no lord; hath this third kind of temptation</p>
<p class="calibre1">also ceased from me, or can it cease through this whole life? To wish,</p>
<p class="calibre1">namely, to be feared and loved of men, for no other end, but that we</p>
<p class="calibre1">may have a joy therein which is no joy? A miserable life this and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">foul boastfulness! Hence especially it comes that men do neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">purely love nor fear Thee. And therefore dost Thou resist the proud,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and givest grace to the humble: yea, Thou thunderest down upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambitions of the world, and the foundations of the mountains</p>
<p class="calibre1">tremble. Because now certain offices of human society make it</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary to be loved and feared of men, the adversary of our true</p>
<p class="calibre1">blessedness layeth hard at us, every where spreading his snares of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“well-done, well-done”; that greedily catching at them, we may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken unawares, and sever our joy from Thy truth, and set it in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceivingness of men; and be pleased at being loved and feared, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">for Thy sake, but in Thy stead: and thus having been made like him, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">may have them for his own, not in the bands of charity, but in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bonds of punishment: who purposed to set his throne in the north, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark and chilled they might serve him, pervertedly and crookedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">imitating Thee. But we, O Lord, behold we are Thy little flock;</p>
<p class="calibre1">possess us as Thine, stretch Thy wings over us, and let us fly under</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. Be Thou our glory; let us be loved for Thee, and Thy word feared</p>
<p class="calibre1">in us. Who would be praised of men when Thou blamest, will not be</p>
<p class="calibre1">defended of men when Thou judgest; nor delivered when Thou condemnest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But when-not the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul, nor he</p>
<p class="calibre1">blessed who doth ungodlily, but-a man is praised for some gift</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Thou hast given him, and he rejoices more at the praise for</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself than that he hath the gift for which he is praised, he also is</p>
<p class="calibre1">praised, while Thou dispraisest; better is he who praised than he</p>
<p class="calibre1">who is praised. For the one took pleasure in the gift of God in man;</p>
<p class="calibre1">the other was better pleased with the gift of man, than of God.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">By these temptations we are assailed daily, O Lord; without</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceasing are we assailed. Our daily furnace is the tongue of men. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">in this way also Thou commandest us continence. Give what Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoinest, and enjoin what Thou wilt. Thou knowest on this matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">the groans of my heart, and the floods of mine eyes. For I cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn how far I am more cleansed from this plague, and I much fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">my secret sins, which Thine eyes know, mine do not. For in other kinds</p>
<p class="calibre1">of temptations I have some sort of means of examining myself; in this,</p>
<p class="calibre1">scarce any. For, in refraining my mind from the pleasures of the flesh</p>
<p class="calibre1">and idle curiosity, I see how much I have attained to, when I do</p>
<p class="calibre1">without them; foregoing, or not having them. For then I ask myself how</p>
<p class="calibre1">much more or less troublesome it is to me not to have them? Then,</p>
<p class="calibre1">riches, which are desired, that they may serve to some one or two or</p>
<p class="calibre1">all of the three concupiscences, if the soul cannot discern whether,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when it hath them, it despiseth them, they may be cast aside, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">so it may prove itself. But to be without praise, and therein essay</p>
<p class="calibre1">our powers, must we live ill, yea so abandonedly and atrociously, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">no one should know without detesting us? What greater madness can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">said or thought of? But if praise useth and ought to accompany a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good life and good works, we ought as little to forego its company, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">good life itself. Yet I know not whether I can well or ill be</p>
<p class="calibre1">without anything, unless it be absent.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What then do I confess unto Thee in this kind of temptation, O Lord?</p>
<p class="calibre1">What, but that I am delighted with praise, but with truth itself, more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than with praise? For were it proposed to me, whether I would, being</p>
<p class="calibre1">frenzied in error on all things, be praised by all men, or being</p>
<p class="calibre1">consistent and most settled in the truth be blamed by all, I see which</p>
<p class="calibre1">I should choose. Yet fain would I that the approbation of another</p>
<p class="calibre1">should not even increase my joy for any good in me. Yet I own, it doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase it, and not so only, but dispraise doth diminish it. And when</p>
<p class="calibre1">I am troubled at this my misery, an excuse occurs to me, which of what</p>
<p class="calibre1">value it is, Thou God knowest, for it leaves me uncertain. For since</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast commanded us not continency alone, that is, from what things</p>
<p class="calibre1">to refrain our love, but righteousness also, that is, whereon to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bestow it, and hast willed us to love not Thee only, but our neighbour</p>
<p class="calibre1">also; often, when pleased with intelligent praise, I seem to myself to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be pleased with the proficiency or towardliness of my neighbour, or to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be grieved for evil in him, when I hear him dispraise either what he</p>
<p class="calibre1">understands not, or is good. For sometimes I am grieved at my own</p>
<p class="calibre1">praise, either when those things be praised in me, in which I</p>
<p class="calibre1">mislike myself, or even lesser and slight goods are more esteemed than</p>
<p class="calibre1">they ought. But again how know I whether I am therefore thus affected,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because I would not have him who praiseth me differ from me about</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself; not as being influenced by concern for him, but because</p>
<p class="calibre1">those same good things which please me in myself, please me more</p>
<p class="calibre1">when they please another also? For some how I am not praised when my</p>
<p class="calibre1">judgment of myself is not praised; forasmuch as either those things</p>
<p class="calibre1">are praised, which displease me; or those more, which please me</p>
<p class="calibre1">less. Am I then doubtful of myself in this matter?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold, in Thee, O Truth, I see that I ought not to be moved at my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own praises, for my own sake, but for the good of my neighbour. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether it be so with me, I know not. For herein I know less of myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">than of Thee. I beseech now, O my God, discover to me myself also,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I may confess unto my brethren, who are to pray for me, wherein I</p>
<p class="calibre1">find myself maimed. Let me examine myself again more diligently. If in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my praise I am moved with the good of my neighbour, why am I less</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved if another be unjustly dispraised than if it be myself? Why am I</p>
<p class="calibre1">more stung by reproach cast upon myself, than at that cast upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">another, with the same injustice, before me? Know I not this also?</p>
<p class="calibre1">or is it at last that I deceive myself, and do not the truth before</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee in my heart and tongue? This madness put far from me, O Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lest mine own mouth be to me the sinner’s oil to make fat my head. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am poor and needy; yet best, while in hidden groanings I displease</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself, and seek Thy mercy, until what is lacking in my defective</p>
<p class="calibre1">state be renewed and perfected, on to that peace which the eye of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the proud knoweth not.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet the word which cometh out of the mouth, and deeds known to</p>
<p class="calibre1">men, bring with them a most dangerous temptation through the love of</p>
<p class="calibre1">praise: which, to establish a certain excellency of our own,</p>
<p class="calibre1">solicits and collects men’s suffrages. It tempts, even when it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">reproved by myself in myself, on the very ground that it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">reproved; and often glories more vainly of the very contempt of</p>
<p class="calibre1">vain-glory; and so it is no longer contempt of vain-glory, whereof</p>
<p class="calibre1">it glories; for it doth not contemn when it glorieth.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within also, within is another evil, arising out of a like</p>
<p class="calibre1">temptation; whereby men become vain, pleasing themselves in</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves, though they please not, or displease or care not to please</p>
<p class="calibre1">others. But pleasing themselves, they much displease Thee, not only</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking pleasure in things not good, as if good, but in Thy good</p>
<p class="calibre1">things, as though their own; or even if as Thine, yet as though for</p>
<p class="calibre1">their own merits; or even if as though from Thy grace, yet not with</p>
<p class="calibre1">brotherly rejoicing, but envying that grace to others. In all these</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the like perils and travails, Thou seest the trembling of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart; and I rather feel my wounds to be cured by Thee, than not</p>
<p class="calibre1">inflicted by me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where hast Thou not walked with me, O Truth, teaching me what to</p>
<p class="calibre1">beware, and what to desire; when I referred to Thee what I could</p>
<p class="calibre1">discover here below, and consulted Thee? With my outward senses, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">I might, I surveyed the world, and observed the life, which my body</p>
<p class="calibre1">hath from me, and these my senses. Thence entered I the recesses of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory, those manifold and spacious chambers, wonderfully furnished</p>
<p class="calibre1">with innumerable stores; and I considered, and stood aghast; being</p>
<p class="calibre1">able to discern nothing of these things without Thee, and finding none</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them to be Thee. Nor was I myself, who found out these things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who went over them all, and laboured to distinguish and to value every</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing according to its dignity, taking some things upon the report</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my senses, questioning about others which I felt to be mingled with</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself, numbering and distinguishing the reporters themselves, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the large treasure-house of my memory revolving some things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">storing up others, drawing out others. Nor yet was I myself when I did</p>
<p class="calibre1">this, i.e., that my power whereby I did it, neither was it Thou, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou art the abiding light, which I consulted concerning all these,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether they were, what they were, and how to be valued; and I heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee directing and commanding me; and this I often do, this delights</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, and as far as I may be freed from necessary duties, unto this</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure have I recourse. Nor in all these which I run over consulting</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee can I find any safe place for my soul, but in Thee; whither my</p>
<p class="calibre1">scattered members may be gathered, and nothing of me depart from Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And sometimes Thou admittest me to an affection, very unusual, in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">inmost soul; rising to a strange sweetness, which if it were perfected</p>
<p class="calibre1">in me, I know not what in it would not belong to the life to come. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">through my miserable encumbrances I sink down again into these lower</p>
<p class="calibre1">things, and am swept back by former custom, and am held, and greatly</p>
<p class="calibre1">weep, but am greatly held. So much doth the burden of a bad custom</p>
<p class="calibre1">weigh us down. Here I can stay, but would not; there I would, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot; both ways, miserable.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus then have I considered the sicknesses of my sins in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">threefold concupiscence, and have called Thy right hand to my help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For with a wounded heart have I beheld Thy brightness, and stricken</p>
<p class="calibre1">back I said, “Who can attain thither? I am cast away from the sight of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thine eyes.” Thou art the Truth who presidest over all, but I</p>
<p class="calibre1">through my covetousness would not indeed forego Thee, but would with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee possess a lie; as no man would in such wise speak falsely, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself to be ignorant of the truth. So then I lost Thee, because Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">vouchsafest not to be possessed with a lie.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whom could I find to reconcile me to Thee? was I to have recourse to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Angels? by what prayers? by what sacraments? Many endeavouring to</p>
<p class="calibre1">return unto Thee, and of themselves unable, have, as I hear, tried</p>
<p class="calibre1">this, and fallen into the desire of curious visions, and been</p>
<p class="calibre1">accounted worthy to be deluded. For they, being high minded, sought</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee by the pride of learning, swelling out rather than smiting upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">their breasts, and so by the agreement of their heart, drew unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves the princes of the air, the fellow-conspirators of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">pride, by whom, through magical influences, they were deceived,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeking a mediator, by whom they might be purged, and there was</p>
<p class="calibre1">none. For the devil it was, transforming himself into an Angel of</p>
<p class="calibre1">light. And it much enticed proud flesh, that he had no body of</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh. For they were mortal, and sinners; but thou, Lord, to whom they</p>
<p class="calibre1">proudly sought to be reconciled, art immortal, and without sin. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">a mediator between God and man must have something like to God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">something like to men; lest being in both like to man, he should he</p>
<p class="calibre1">far from God: or if in both like God, too unlike man: and so not be</p>
<p class="calibre1">a mediator. That deceitful mediator then, by whom in Thy secret</p>
<p class="calibre1">judgments pride deserved to be deluded, hath one thing in common</p>
<p class="calibre1">with man, that is sin; another he would seem to have in common with</p>
<p class="calibre1">God; and not being clothed with the mortality of flesh, would vaunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself to be immortal. But since the wages of sin is death, this hath</p>
<p class="calibre1">he in common with men, that with them he should be condemned to death.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the true Mediator, Whom in Thy secret mercy Thou hast showed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the humble, and sentest, that by His example also they might</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn that same humility, that Mediator between God and man, the Man</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ Jesus, appeared betwixt mortal sinners and the immortal just</p>
<p class="calibre1">One; mortal with men, just with God: that because the wages of</p>
<p class="calibre1">righteousness is life and peace, He might by a righteousness conjoined</p>
<p class="calibre1">with God make void that death of sinners, now made righteous, which He</p>
<p class="calibre1">willed to have in common with them. Hence He was showed forth to</p>
<p class="calibre1">holy men of old; that so they, through faith in His Passion to come,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as we through faith of it passed, might be saved. For as Man, He was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mediator; but as the Word, not in the middle between God and man,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because equal to God, and God with God, and together one God.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">How hast Thou loved us, good Father, who sparedst not Thine only</p>
<p class="calibre1">Son, but deliveredst Him up for us ungodly! How hast Thou loved us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">for whom He that thought it no robbery to be equal with Thee, was made</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject even to the death of the cross, He alone, free among the dead,</p>
<p class="calibre1">having power to lay down His life, and power to take it again: for</p>
<p class="calibre1">us to Thee both Victor and Victim, and therefore Victor, because the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Victim; for us to Thee Priest and Sacrifice, and therefore Priest</p>
<p class="calibre1">because the Sacrifice; making us to Thee, of servants, sons by being</p>
<p class="calibre1">born of Thee, and serving us. Well then is my hope strong in Him, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou wilt heal all my infirmities, by Him Who sitteth at Thy right</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand and maketh intercession for us; else should I despair. For many</p>
<p class="calibre1">and great are my infirmities, many they are, and great; but Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">medicine is mightier. We might imagine that Thy Word was far from</p>
<p class="calibre1">any union with man, and despair of ourselves, unless He had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">made flesh and dwelt among us.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Affrighted with my sins and the burden of my misery, I had cast in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my heart, and had purposed to flee to the wilderness: but Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">forbadest me, and strengthenedst me, saying, Therefore Christ died for</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, that they which live may now no longer live unto themselves,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but unto Him that died for them. See, Lord, I cast my care upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, that I may live, and consider wondrous things out of Thy law.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou knowest my unskilfulness, and my infirmities; teach me, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">heal me. He, Thine only Son, in Whom are hid all the treasures of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom and knowledge, hath redeemed me with His blood. Let not the</p>
<p class="calibre1">proud speak evil of me; because I meditate on my ransom, and eat and</p>
<p class="calibre1">drink, and communicate it; and poor, desired to be satisfied from Him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">amongst those that eat and are satisfied, and they shall praise the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord who seek Him.</p>
