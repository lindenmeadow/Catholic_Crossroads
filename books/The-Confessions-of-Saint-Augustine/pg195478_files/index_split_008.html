<h2 id="calibre_toc_5" class="calibre7">BOOK IV</h2><p class="calibre1">For this space of nine years (from my nineteenth year to my</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight-and-twentieth) we lived seduced and seducing, deceived and</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceiving, in divers lusts; openly, by sciences which they call</p>
<p class="calibre1">liberal; secretly, with a false-named religion; here proud, there</p>
<p class="calibre1">superstitious, every where vain. Here, hunting after the emptiness</p>
<p class="calibre1">of popular praise, down even to theatrical applauses, and poetic</p>
<p class="calibre1">prizes, and strifes for grassy garlands, and the follies of shows, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the intemperance of desires. There, desiring to be cleansed from these</p>
<p class="calibre1">defilements, by carrying food to those who were called “elect” and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“holy,” out of which, in the workhouse of their stomachs, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">should forge for us Angels and Gods, by whom we might be cleansed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These things did I follow, and practise with my friends, deceived by</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, and with me. Let the arrogant mock me, and such as have not</p>
<p class="calibre1">been, to their soul’s health, stricken and cast down by Thee, O my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God; but I would still confess to Thee mine own shame in Thy praise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suffer me, I beseech Thee, and give me grace to go over in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">present remembrance the wanderings of my forepassed time, and to offer</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving. For what am I to myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">without Thee, but a guide to mine own downfall? or what am I even at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the best, but an infant sucking the milk Thou givest, and feeding upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, the food that perisheth not? But what sort of man is any man,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing he is but a man? Let now the strong and the mighty laugh at us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but let us poor and needy confess unto Thee.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In those years I taught rhetoric, and, overcome by cupidity, made</p>
<p class="calibre1">sale of a loquacity to overcome by. Yet I preferred (Lord, Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowest) honest scholars (as they are accounted), and these I, without</p>
<p class="calibre1">artifice, taught artifices, not to be practised against the life of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the guiltless, though sometimes for the life of the guilty. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou, O God, from afar perceivedst me stumbling in that slippery</p>
<p class="calibre1">course, and amid much smoke sending out some sparks of faithfulness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which I showed in that my guidance of such as loved vanity, and sought</p>
<p class="calibre1">after leasing, myself their companion. In those years I had one,</p>
<p class="calibre1">-not in that which is called lawful marriage, but whom I had found out</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a wayward passion, void of understanding; yet but one, remaining</p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful even to her; in whom I in my own case experienced what</p>
<p class="calibre1">difference there is betwixt the self-restraint of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">marriage-covenant, for the sake of issue, and the bargain of a lustful</p>
<p class="calibre1">love, where children are born against their parents’ will, although,</p>
<p class="calibre1">once born, they constrain love.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember also, that when I had settled to enter the lists for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">theatrical prize, some wizard asked me what I would give him to win;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but I, detesting and abhorring such foul mysteries, answered,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Though the garland were of imperishable gold, I would not suffer a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fly to be killed to gain me it. ” For he was to kill some living</p>
<p class="calibre1">creatures in his sacrifices, and by those honours to invite the devils</p>
<p class="calibre1">to favour me. But this ill also I rejected, not out of a pure love for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, O God of my heart; for I knew not how to love Thee, who knew not</p>
<p class="calibre1">how to conceive aught beyond a material brightness. And doth not a</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul, sighing after such fictions, commit fornication against Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trust in things unreal, and feed the wind? Still I would not</p>
<p class="calibre1">forsooth have sacrifices offered to devils for me, to whom I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrificing myself by that superstition. For what else is it to feed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the wind, but to feed them, that is by going astray to become their</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure and derision?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those impostors then, whom they style Mathematicians, I consulted</p>
<p class="calibre1">without scruple; because they seemed to use no sacrifice, nor to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pray to any spirit for their divinations: which art, however,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian and true piety consistently rejects and condemns. For, it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a good thing to confess unto Thee, and to say, Have mercy upon me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee; and not to abuse Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">mercy for a licence to sin, but to remember the Lord’s words,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">thee. All which wholesome advice they labour to destroy, saying,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The cause of thy sin is inevitably determined in heaven”; and “This</p>
<p class="calibre1">did Venus, or Saturn, or Mars”: that man, forsooth, flesh and blood,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and proud corruption, might be blameless; while the Creator and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ordainer of heaven and the stars is to bear the blame. And who is He</p>
<p class="calibre1">but our God? the very sweetness and well-spring of righteousness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who renderest to every man according to his works: and a broken and</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrite heart wilt Thou not despise.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was in those days a wise man, very skilful in physic, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">renowned therein, who had with his own proconsular hand put the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agonistic garland upon my distempered head, but not as a physician:</p>
<p class="calibre1">for this disease Thou only curest, who resistest the proud, and givest</p>
<p class="calibre1">grace to the humble. But didst Thou fail me even by that old man, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">forbear to heal my soul? For having become more acquainted with him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and hanging assiduously and fixedly on his speech (for though in</p>
<p class="calibre1">simple terms, it was vivid, lively, and earnest), when he had gathered</p>
<p class="calibre1">by my discourse that I was given to the books of nativity-casters,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he kindly and fatherly advised me to cast them away, and not</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruitlessly bestow a care and diligence, necessary for useful</p>
<p class="calibre1">things, upon these vanities; saying, that he had in his earliest years</p>
<p class="calibre1">studied that art, so as to make it the profession whereby he should</p>
<p class="calibre1">live, and that, understanding Hippocrates, he could soon have</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood such a study as this; and yet he had given it over, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken to physic, for no other reason but that he found it utterly</p>
<p class="calibre1">false; and he, a grave man, would not get his living by deluding</p>
<p class="calibre1">people. “But thou,” saith he, “hast rhetoric to maintain thyself by,</p>
<p class="calibre1">so that thou followest this of free choice, not of necessity: the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">then oughtest thou to give me credit herein, who laboured to acquire</p>
<p class="calibre1">it so perfectly as to get my living by it alone.” Of whom when I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded, how then could many true things be foretold by it, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered me (as he could) “that the force of chance, diffused</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout the whole order of things, brought this about. For if</p>
<p class="calibre1">when a man by haphazard opens the pages of some poet, who sang and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought of something wholly different, a verse oftentimes fell out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondrously agreeable to the present business: it were not to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered at, if out of the soul of man, unconscious what takes place</p>
<p class="calibre1">in it, by some higher instinct an answer should be given, by hap,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not by art, corresponding to the business and actions of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">demander.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And thus much, either from or through him, Thou conveyedst to me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and tracedst in my memory, what I might hereafter examine for</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself. But at that time neither he, nor my dearest Nebridius, a youth</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularly good and of a holy fear, who derided the whole body of</p>
<p class="calibre1">divination, could persuade me to cast it aside, the authority of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">authors swaying me yet more, and as yet I had found no certain proof</p>
<p class="calibre1">(such as I sought) whereby it might without all doubt appear, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">what had been truly foretold by those consulted was the result of</p>
<p class="calibre1">haphazard, not of the art of the star-gazers.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In those years when I first began to teach rhetoric in my native</p>
<p class="calibre1">town, I had made one my friend, but too dear to me, from a community</p>
<p class="calibre1">of pursuits, of mine own age, and, as myself, in the first opening</p>
<p class="calibre1">flower of youth. He had grown up of a child with me, and we had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">both school-fellows and play-fellows. But he was not yet my friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">as afterwards, nor even then, as true friendship is; for true it</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot be, unless in such as Thou cementest together, cleaving unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, by that love which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ghost, which is given unto us. Yet was it but too sweet, ripened by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the warmth of kindred studies: for, from the true faith (which he as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">youth had not soundly and thoroughly imbibed), I had warped him also</p>
<p class="calibre1">to those superstitious and pernicious fables, for which my mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">bewailed me. With me he now erred in mind, nor could my soul be</p>
<p class="calibre1">without him. But behold Thou wert close on the steps of Thy fugitives,</p>
<p class="calibre1">at once God of vengeance, and Fountain of mercies, turning us to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyself by wonderful means; Thou tookest that man out of this life,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when he had scarce filled up one whole year of my friendship, sweet to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me above all sweetness of that my life.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who can recount all Thy praises, which he hath felt in his one self?</p>
<p class="calibre1">What diddest Thou then, my God, and how unsearchable is the abyss of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy judgments? For long, sore sick of a fever, he lay senseless in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">death-sweat; and his recovery being despaired of, he was baptised,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unknowing; myself meanwhile little regarding, and presuming that his</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul would retain rather what it had received of me, not what was</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrought on his unconscious body. But it proved far otherwise: for he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was refreshed, and restored. Forthwith, as soon as I could speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">with him (and I could, so soon as he was able, for I never left him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and we hung but too much upon each other), I essayed to jest with him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as though he would jest with me at that baptism which he had received,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when utterly absent in mind and feeling, but had now understood that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he had received. But he so shrunk from me, as from an enemy; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a wonderful and sudden freedom bade me, as I would continue his</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend, forbear such language to him. I, all astonished and amazed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppressed all my emotions till he should grow well, and his health</p>
<p class="calibre1">were strong enough for me to deal with him as I would. But he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken away from my frenzy, that with Thee he might be preserved for my</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfort; a few days after in my absence, he was attacked again by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fever, and so departed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this grief my heart was utterly darkened; and whatever I beheld</p>
<p class="calibre1">was death. My native country was a torment to me, and my father’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">house a strange unhappiness; and whatever I had shared with him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanting him, became a distracting torture. Mine eyes sought him</p>
<p class="calibre1">every where, but he was not granted them; and I hated all places,</p>
<p class="calibre1">for that they had not him; nor could they now tell me, “he is coming,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">as when he was alive and absent. I became a great riddle to myself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I asked my soul, why she was so sad, and why she disquieted me</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorely: but she knew not what to answer me. And if I said, Trust in</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, she very rightly obeyed me not; because that most dear friend,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom she had lost, was, being man, both truer and better than that</p>
<p class="calibre1">phantasm she was bid to trust in. Only tears were sweet to me, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">they succeeded my friend, in the dearest of my affections.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now, Lord, these things are passed by, and time hath assuaged my</p>
<p class="calibre1">wound. May I learn from Thee, who art Truth, and approach the ear of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my heart unto Thy mouth, that Thou mayest tell me why weeping is sweet</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the miserable? Hast Thou, although present every where, cast away</p>
<p class="calibre1">our misery far from Thee? And Thou abidest in Thyself, but we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">tossed about in divers trials. And yet unless we mourned in Thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears, we should have no hope left. Whence then is sweet fruit gathered</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the bitterness of life, from groaning, tears, sighs, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">complaints? Doth this sweeten it, that we hope Thou hearest? This is</p>
<p class="calibre1">true of prayer, for therein is a longing to approach unto Thee. But is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it also in grief for a thing lost, and the sorrow wherewith I was then</p>
<p class="calibre1">overwhelmed? For I neither hoped he should return to life nor did I</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire this with my tears; but I wept only and grieved. For I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">miserable, and had lost my joy. Or is weeping indeed a bitter thing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and for very loathing of the things which we before enjoyed, does it</p>
<p class="calibre1">then, when we shrink from them, please us?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what speak I of these things? for now is no time to question,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but to confess unto Thee. Wretched I was; and wretched is every soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">bound by the friendship of perishable things; he is torn asunder</p>
<p class="calibre1">when he loses them, and then he feels the wretchedness which he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">ere yet he lost them. So was it then with me; I wept most bitterly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and found my repose in bitterness. Thus was I wretched, and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">wretched life I held dearer than my friend. For though I would</p>
<p class="calibre1">willingly have changed it, yet was I more unwilling to part with it</p>
<p class="calibre1">than with him; yea, I know not whether I would have parted with it</p>
<p class="calibre1">even for him, as is related (if not feigned) of Pylades and Orestes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that they would gladly have died for each other or together, not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">live together being to them worse than death. But in me there had</p>
<p class="calibre1">arisen some unexplained feeling, too contrary to this, for at once I</p>
<p class="calibre1">loathed exceedingly to live and feared to die. I suppose, the more I</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved him, the more did I hate, and fear (as a most cruel enemy)</p>
<p class="calibre1">death, which had bereaved me of him: and I imagined it would</p>
<p class="calibre1">speedily make an end of all men, since it had power over him. Thus was</p>
<p class="calibre1">it with me, I remember. Behold my heart, O my God, behold and see into</p>
<p class="calibre1">me; for well I remember it, O my Hope, who cleansest me from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">impurity of such affections, directing mine eyes towards Thee, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">plucking my feet out of the snare. For I wondered that others, subject</p>
<p class="calibre1">to death, did live, since he whom I loved, as if he should never</p>
<p class="calibre1">die, was dead; and I wondered yet more that myself, who was to him a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second self, could live, he being dead. Well said one of his friend,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thou half of my soul”; for I felt that my soul and his soul were “one</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul in two bodies”: and therefore was my life a horror to me, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would not live halved. And therefore perchance I feared to die, lest</p>
<p class="calibre1">he whom I had much loved should die wholly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">O madness, which knowest not how to love men, like men! O foolish</p>
<p class="calibre1">man that I then was, enduring impatiently the lot of man! I fretted</p>
<p class="calibre1">then, sighed, wept, was distracted; had neither rest nor counsel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For I bore about a shattered and bleeding soul, impatient of being</p>
<p class="calibre1">borne by me, yet where to repose it, I found not. Not in calm</p>
<p class="calibre1">groves, not in games and music, nor in fragrant spots, nor in</p>
<p class="calibre1">curious banquetings, nor in the pleasures of the bed and the couch;</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor (finally) in books or poesy, found it repose. All things looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghastly, yea, the very light; whatsoever was not what he was, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolting and hateful, except groaning and tears. For in those alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">found I a little refreshment. But when my soul was withdrawn from them</p>
<p class="calibre1">a huge load of misery weighed me down. To Thee, O Lord, it ought to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have been raised, for Thee to lighten; I knew it; but neither could</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor would; the more, since, when I thought of Thee, Thou wert not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me any solid or substantial thing. For Thou wert not Thyself, but a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mere phantom, and my error was my God. If I offered to discharge my</p>
<p class="calibre1">load thereon, that it might rest, it glided through the void, and came</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushing down again on me; and I had remained to myself a hapless spot,</p>
<p class="calibre1">where I could neither be, nor be from thence. For whither should my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart flee from my heart? Whither should I flee from myself? Whither</p>
<p class="calibre1">not follow myself? And yet I fled out of my country; for so should</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine eyes less look for him, where they were not wont to see him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And thus from Thagaste, I came to Carthage.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Times lose no time; nor do they roll idly by; through our senses</p>
<p class="calibre1">they work strange operations on the mind. Behold, they went and came</p>
<p class="calibre1">day by day, and by coming and going, introduced into my mind other</p>
<p class="calibre1">imaginations and other remembrances; and little by little patched me</p>
<p class="calibre1">up again with my old kind of delights, unto which that my sorrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave way. And yet there succeeded, not indeed other griefs, yet the</p>
<p class="calibre1">causes of other griefs. For whence had that former grief so easily</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached my very inmost soul, but that I had poured out my soul upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dust, in loving one that must die, as if he would never die? For</p>
<p class="calibre1">what restored and refreshed me chiefly was the solaces of other</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends, with whom I did love, what instead of Thee I loved; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">this was a great fable, and protracted lie, by whose adulterous</p>
<p class="calibre1">stimulus, our soul, which lay itching in our ears, was being</p>
<p class="calibre1">defiled. But that fable would not die to me, so oft as any of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends died. There were other things which in them did more take my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind; to talk and jest together, to do kind offices by turns; to</p>
<p class="calibre1">read together honied books; to play the fool or be earnest together;</p>
<p class="calibre1">to dissent at times without discontent, as a man might with his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">self; and even with the seldomness of these dissentings, to season our</p>
<p class="calibre1">more frequent consentings; sometimes to teach, and sometimes learn;</p>
<p class="calibre1">long for the absent with impatience; and welcome the coming with</p>
<p class="calibre1">joy. These and the like expressions, proceeding out of the hearts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">those that loved and were loved again, by the countenance, the tongue,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the eyes, and a thousand pleasing gestures, were so much fuel to</p>
<p class="calibre1">melt our souls together, and out of many make but one.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is it that is loved in friends; and so loved, that a man’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscience condemns itself, if he love not him that loves him again,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or love not again him that loves him, looking for nothing from his</p>
<p class="calibre1">person but indications of his love. Hence that mourning, if one die,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and darkenings of sorrows, that steeping of the heart in tears, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweetness turned to bitterness; and upon the loss of life of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dying, the death of the living. Blessed whoso loveth Thee, and his</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend in Thee, and his enemy for Thee. For he alone loses none dear</p>
<p class="calibre1">to him, to whom all are dear in Him who cannot be lost. And who is</p>
<p class="calibre1">this but our God, the God that made heaven and earth, and filleth</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, because by filling them He created them? Thee none loseth, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">who leaveth. And who leaveth Thee, whither goeth or whither teeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">he, but from Thee well-pleased, to Thee displeased? For where doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">he not find Thy law in his own punishment? And Thy law is truth, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth Thou.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turn us, O God of Hosts, show us Thy countenance, and we shall be</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole. For whithersoever the soul of man turns itself, unless toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, it is riveted upon sorrows, yea though it is riveted on things</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful. And yet they, out of Thee, and out of the soul, were not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless they were from Thee. They rise, and set; and by rising, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin as it were to be; they grow, that they may be perfected; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfected, they wax old and wither; and all grow not old, but all</p>
<p class="calibre1">wither. So then when they rise and tend to be, the more quickly they</p>
<p class="calibre1">grow that they may be, so much the more they haste not to be. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">is the law of them. Thus much has Thou allotted them, because they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">portions of things, which exist not all at once, but by passing away</p>
<p class="calibre1">and succeeding, they together complete that universe, whereof they are</p>
<p class="calibre1">portions. And even thus is our speech completed by signs giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth a sound: but this again is not perfected unless one word pass</p>
<p class="calibre1">away when it hath sounded its part, that another may succeed. Out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all these things let my soul praise Thee, O God, Creator of all; yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">let not my soul be riveted unto these things with the glue of love,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the senses of the body. For they go whither they were to go,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that they might not be; and they rend her with pestilent longings,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because she longs to be, yet loves to repose in what she loves. But in</p>
<p class="calibre1">these things is no place of repose; they abide not, they flee; and who</p>
<p class="calibre1">can follow them with the senses of the flesh? yea, who can grasp them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when they are hard by? For the sense of the flesh is slow, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is the sense of the flesh; and thereby is it bounded. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficeth for that it was made for; but it sufficeth not to stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">things running their course from their appointed starting-place to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end appointed. For in Thy Word, by which they are created, they hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">their decree, “hence and hitherto.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Be not foolish, O my soul, nor become deaf in the ear of thine heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the tumult of thy folly. Hearken thou too.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Word itself calleth thee to return: and there is the place of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest imperturbable, where love is not forsaken, if itself forsaketh</p>
<p class="calibre1">not. Behold, these things pass away, that others may replace them, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so this lower universe be completed by all his parts. But do I</p>
<p class="calibre1">depart any whither? saith the Word of God. There fix thy dwelling,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trust there whatsoever thou hast thence, O my soul, at least now</p>
<p class="calibre1">thou art tired out with vanities. Entrust Truth, whatsoever thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">hast from the Truth, and thou shalt lose nothing; and thy decay</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall bloom again, and all thy diseases be healed, and thy mortal</p>
<p class="calibre1">parts be reformed and renewed, and bound around thee: nor shall they</p>
<p class="calibre1">lay thee whither themselves descend; but they shall stand fast with</p>
<p class="calibre1">thee, and abide for ever before God, Who abideth and standeth fast for</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why then be perverted and follow thy flesh? Be it converted and</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow thee. Whatever by her thou hast sense of, is in part; and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole, whereof these are parts, thou knowest not; and yet they delight</p>
<p class="calibre1">thee. But had the sense of thy flesh a capacity for comprehending</p>
<p class="calibre1">the whole, and not itself also, for thy punishment, been justly</p>
<p class="calibre1">restricted to a part of the whole, thou wouldest, that whatsoever</p>
<p class="calibre1">existeth at this present, should pass away, that so the whole might</p>
<p class="calibre1">better please thee. For what we speak also, by the same sense of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh thou hearest; yet wouldest not thou have the syllables stay, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">fly away, that others may come, and thou hear the whole. And so</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever, when any one thing is made up of many, all of which do not exist</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, all collectively would please more than they do severally,</p>
<p class="calibre1">could all be perceived collectively. But far better than these is He</p>
<p class="calibre1">who made all; and He is our God, nor doth He pass away, for neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">doth aught succeed Him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">If bodies please thee, praise God on occasion of them, and turn back</p>
<p class="calibre1">thy love upon their Maker; lest in these things which please thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">thou displease. If souls please thee, be they loved in God: for they</p>
<p class="calibre1">too are mutable, but in Him are they firmly stablished; else would</p>
<p class="calibre1">they pass, and pass away. In Him then be they beloved; and carry</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Him along with thee what souls thou canst, and say to them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Him let us love, Him let us love: He made these, nor is He far off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For He did not make them, and so depart, but they are of Him, and in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him. See there He is, where truth is loved. He is within the very</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, yet hath the heart strayed from Him. Go back into your heart,</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye transgressors, and cleave fast to Him that made you. Stand with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him, and ye shall stand fast. Rest in Him, and ye shall be at rest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whither go ye in rough ways? Whither go ye? The good that you love</p>
<p class="calibre1">is from Him; but it is good and pleasant through reference to Him, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">justly shall it be embittered, because unjustly is any thing loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is from Him, if He be forsaken for it. To what end then would ye</p>
<p class="calibre1">still and still walk these difficult and toilsome ways? There is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest, where ye seek it. Seek what ye seek; but it is not there where</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye seek. Ye seek a blessed life in the land of death; it is not there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For how should there be a blessed life where life itself is not?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But our true Life came down hither, and bore our death, and slew</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, out of the abundance of His own life: and He thundered, calling</p>
<p class="calibre1">aloud to us to return hence to Him into that secret place, whence He</p>
<p class="calibre1">came forth to us, first into the Virgin’s womb, wherein He espoused</p>
<p class="calibre1">the human creation, our mortal flesh, that it might not be for ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">mortal, and thence like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejoicing as a giant to run his course. For He lingered not, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">ran, calling aloud by words, deeds, death, life, descent, ascension;</p>
<p class="calibre1">crying aloud to us to return unto Him. And He departed from our</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes, that we might return into our heart, and there find Him. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">He departed, and to, He is here. He would not be long with us, yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">left us not; for He departed thither, whence He never parted,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because the world was made by Him. And in this world He was, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">into this world He came to save sinners, unto whom my soul confesseth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and He healeth it, for it hath sinned against Him. O ye sons of men,</p>
<p class="calibre1">how long so slow of heart? Even now, after the descent of Life to you,</p>
<p class="calibre1">will ye not ascend and live? But whither ascend ye, when ye are on</p>
<p class="calibre1">high, and set your mouth against the heavens? Descend, that ye may</p>
<p class="calibre1">ascend, and ascend to God. For ye have fallen, by ascending against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him.” Tell them this, that they may weep in the valley of tears, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so carry them up with thee unto God; because out of His spirit thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">speakest thus unto them, if thou speakest, burning with the fire of</p>
<p class="calibre1">charity.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">These things I then knew not, and I loved these lower beauties,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I was sinking to the very depths, and to my friends I said, “Do we</p>
<p class="calibre1">love any thing but the beautiful? What then is the beautiful? and what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is beauty? What is it that attracts and wins us to the things we love?</p>
<p class="calibre1">for unless there were in them a grace and beauty, they could by no</p>
<p class="calibre1">means draw us unto them.” And I marked and perceived that in bodies</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves, there was a beauty, from their forming a sort of whole,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and again, another from apt and mutual correspondence, as of a part of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the body with its whole, or a shoe with a foot, and the like. And this</p>
<p class="calibre1">consideration sprang up in my mind, out of my inmost heart, and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote “on the fair and fit,” I think, two or three books. Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowest, O Lord, for it is gone from me; for I have them not, but they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are strayed from me, I know not how.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what moved me, O Lord my God, to dedicate these books unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hierius, an orator of Rome, whom I knew not by face, but loved for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fame of his learning which was eminent in him, and some words of his I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had heard, which pleased me? But more did he please me, for that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased others, who highly extolled him, amazed that out of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Syrian, first instructed in Greek eloquence, should afterwards be</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed a wonderful Latin orator, and one most learned in things</p>
<p class="calibre1">pertaining unto philosophy. One is commended, and, unseen, he is</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved: doth this love enter the heart of the hearer from the mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the commender? Not so. But by one who loveth is another kindled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For hence he is loved who is commended, when the commender is believed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to extol him with an unfeigned heart; that is, when one that loves</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, praises him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For so did I then love men, upon the judgment of men, not Thine, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">my God, in Whom no man is deceived. But yet why not for qualities,</p>
<p class="calibre1">like those of a famous charioteer, or fighter with beasts in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">theatre, known far and wide by a vulgar popularity, but far otherwise,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and earnestly, and so as I would be myself commended? For I would</p>
<p class="calibre1">not be commended or loved, as actors are (though I myself did</p>
<p class="calibre1">commend and love them), but had rather be unknown, than so known;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and even hated, than so loved. Where now are the impulses to such</p>
<p class="calibre1">various and divers kinds of loves laid up in one soul? Why, since we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are equally men, do I love in another what, if I did not hate, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">should not spurn and cast from myself? For it holds not, that as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good horse is loved by him, who would not, though he might, be that</p>
<p class="calibre1">horse, therefore the same may be said of an actor, who shares our</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature. Do I then love in a man, what I hate to be, who am a man?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Man himself is a great deep, whose very hairs Thou numberest, O</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord, and they fall not to the ground without Thee. And yet are the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hairs of his head easier to be numbered than his feelings, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beatings of his heart.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that orator was of that sort whom I loved, as wishing to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself such; and I erred through a swelling pride, and was tossed</p>
<p class="calibre1">about with every wind, but yet was steered by Thee, though very</p>
<p class="calibre1">secretly. And whence do I know, and whence do I confidently confess</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Thee, that I had loved him more for the love of his commenders,</p>
<p class="calibre1">than for the very things for which he was commended? Because, had he</p>
<p class="calibre1">been unpraised, and these self-same men had dispraised him, and with</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispraise and contempt told the very same things of him, I had never</p>
<p class="calibre1">been so kindled and excited to love him. And yet the things had not</p>
<p class="calibre1">been other, nor he himself other; but only the feelings of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">relators. See where the impotent soul lies along, that is not yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">stayed up by the solidity of truth! Just as the gales of tongues</p>
<p class="calibre1">blow from the breast of the opinionative, so is it carried this way</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that, driven forward and backward, and the light is overclouded to</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, and the truth unseen. And to, it is before us. And it was to me</p>
<p class="calibre1">a great matter, that my discourse and labours should be known to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that man: which should he approve, I were the more kindled; but if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he disapproved, my empty heart, void of Thy solidity, had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">wounded. And yet the “fair and fit,” whereon I wrote to him, I dwelt</p>
<p class="calibre1">on with pleasure, and surveyed it, and admired it, though none</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined therein.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I saw not yet, whereon this weighty matter turned in Thy wisdom,</p>
<p class="calibre1">O Thou Omnipotent, who only doest wonders; and my mind ranged</p>
<p class="calibre1">through corporeal forms; and “fair,” I defined and distinguished</p>
<p class="calibre1">what is so in itself, and “fit,” whose beauty is in correspondence</p>
<p class="calibre1">to some other thing: and this I supported by corporeal examples. And I</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned to the nature of the mind, but the false notion which I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">of spiritual things, let me not see the truth. Yet the force of</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth did of itself flash into mine eyes, and I turned away my panting</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul from incorporeal substance to lineaments, and colours, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bulky magnitudes. And not being able to see these in the mind, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought I could not see my mind. And whereas in virtue I loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">peace, and in viciousness I abhorred discord; in the first I</p>
<p class="calibre1">observed a unity, but in the other, a sort of division. And in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">unity I conceived the rational soul, and the nature of truth and of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the chief good to consist; but in this division I miserably imagined</p>
<p class="calibre1">there to be some unknown substance of irrational life, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature of the chief evil, which should not only be a substance, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">real life also, and yet not derived from Thee, O my God, of whom are</p>
<p class="calibre1">all things. And yet that first I called a Monad, as it had been a soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">without sex; but the latter a Duad; -anger, in deeds of violence,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and in flagitiousness, lust; not knowing whereof I spake. For I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">not known or learned that neither was evil a substance, nor our soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">that chief and unchangeable good.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For as deeds of violence arise, if that emotion of the soul be</p>
<p class="calibre1">corrupted, whence vehement action springs, stirring itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">insolently and unrulily; and lusts, when that affection of the soul is</p>
<p class="calibre1">ungoverned, whereby carnal pleasures are drunk in, so do errors and</p>
<p class="calibre1">false opinions defile the conversation, if the reasonable soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself be corrupted; as it was then in me, who knew not that it must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be enlightened by another light, that it may be partaker of truth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing itself is not that nature of truth. For Thou shalt light my</p>
<p class="calibre1">candle, O Lord my God, Thou shalt enlighten my darkness: and of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">fulness have we all received, for Thou art the true light that</p>
<p class="calibre1">lighteth every man that cometh into the world; for in Thee there is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">variableness, neither shadow of change.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I pressed towards Thee, and was thrust from Thee, that I might</p>
<p class="calibre1">taste of death: for thou resistest the proud. But what prouder, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">for me with a strange madness to maintain myself to be that by</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature which Thou art? For whereas I was subject to change (so much</p>
<p class="calibre1">being manifest to me, my very desire to become wise, being the wish,</p>
<p class="calibre1">of worse to become better), yet chose I rather to imagine Thee subject</p>
<p class="calibre1">to change, and myself not to be that which Thou art. Therefore I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">repelled by Thee, and Thou resistedst my vain stiffneckedness, and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined corporeal forms, and, myself flesh, I accused flesh; and, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wind that passeth away, I returned not to Thee, but I passed on and on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to things which have no being, neither in Thee, nor in me, nor in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the body. Neither were they created for me by Thy truth, but by my</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanity devised out of things corporeal. And I was wont to ask Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful little ones, my fellow-citizens (from whom, unknown to</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself, I stood exiled), I was wont, prating and foolishly, to ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, “Why then doth the soul err which God created?” But I would</p>
<p class="calibre1">not be asked, “Why then doth God err?” And I maintained that Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchangeable substance did err upon constraint, rather than confess</p>
<p class="calibre1">that my changeable substance had gone astray voluntarily, and now,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in punishment, lay in error.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was then some six or seven and twenty years old when I wrote those</p>
<p class="calibre1">volumes; revolving within me corporeal fictions, buzzing in the ears</p>
<p class="calibre1">of my heart, which I turned, O sweet truth, to thy inward melody,</p>
<p class="calibre1">meditating on the “fair and fit,” and longing to stand and hearken</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thee, and to rejoice greatly at the Bridegroom’s voice, but could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not; for by the voices of mine own errors, I was hurried abroad, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the weight of my own pride, I was sinking into the lowest pit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For Thou didst not make me to hear joy and gladness, nor did the bones</p>
<p class="calibre1">exult which were not yet humbled.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what did it profit me, that scarce twenty years old, a book of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aristotle, which they call the often Predicaments, falling into my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands (on whose very name I hung, as on something great and divine, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">often as my rhetoric master of Carthage, and others, accounted</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned, mouthed it with cheeks bursting with pride), I read and</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood it unaided? And on my conferring with others, who said that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they scarcely understood it with very able tutors, not only orally</p>
<p class="calibre1">explaining it, but drawing many things in sand, they could tell me</p>
<p class="calibre1">no more of it than I had learned, reading it by myself. And the book</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared to me to speak very clearly of substances, such as “man,” and</p>
<p class="calibre1">of their qualities, as the figure of a man, of what sort it is; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stature, how many feet high; and his relationship, whose brother he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is; or where placed; or when born; or whether he stands or sits; or be</p>
<p class="calibre1">shod or armed; or does, or suffers anything; and all the innumerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">things which might be ranged under these nine Predicaments, of which I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have given some specimens, or under that chief Predicament of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Substance.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What did all this further me, seeing it even hindered me? when,</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagining whatever was, was comprehended under those often</p>
<p class="calibre1">Predicaments, I essayed in such wise to understand, O my God, Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful and unchangeable Unity also, as if Thou also hadst been</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjected to Thine own greatness or beauty; so that (as in bodies)</p>
<p class="calibre1">they should exist in Thee, as their subject: whereas Thou Thyself</p>
<p class="calibre1">art Thy greatness and beauty; but a body is not great or fair in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it is a body, seeing that, though it were less great or fair,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it should notwithstanding be a body. But it was falsehood which of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee I conceived, not truth, fictions of my misery, not the</p>
<p class="calibre1">realities of Thy blessedness. For Thou hadst commanded, and it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">done in me, that the earth should bring forth briars and thorns to me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that in the sweat of my brows I should eat my bread.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what did it profit me, that all the books I could procure of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">socalled liberal arts, I, the vile slave of vile affections, read</p>
<p class="calibre1">by myself, and understood? And I delighted in them, but knew not</p>
<p class="calibre1">whence came all, that therein was true or certain. For I had my back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the light, and my face to the things enlightened; whence my face,</p>
<p class="calibre1">with which I discerned the things enlightened, itself was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">enlightened. Whatever was written, either on rhetoric, or logic,</p>
<p class="calibre1">geometry, music, and arithmetic, by myself without much difficulty</p>
<p class="calibre1">or any instructor, I understood, Thou knowest, O Lord my God;</p>
<p class="calibre1">because both quickness of understanding, and acuteness in</p>
<p class="calibre1">discerning, is Thy gift: yet did I not thence sacrifice to Thee. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">then it served not to my use, but rather to my perdition, since I went</p>
<p class="calibre1">about to get so good a portion of my substance into my own keeping;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I kept not my strength for Thee, but wandered from Thee into a far</p>
<p class="calibre1">country, to spend it upon harlotries. For what profited me good</p>
<p class="calibre1">abilities, not employed to good uses? For I felt not that those arts</p>
<p class="calibre1">were attained with great difficulty, even by the studious and</p>
<p class="calibre1">talented, until I attempted to explain them to such; when he most</p>
<p class="calibre1">excelled in them who followed me not altogether slowly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what did this further me, imagining that Thou, O Lord God, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Truth, wert a vast and bright body, and I a fragment of that body?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perverseness too great! But such was I. Nor do I blush, O my God, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess to Thee Thy mercies towards me, and to call upon Thee, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">blushed not then to profess to men my blasphemies, and to bark against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee. What profited me then my nimble wit in those sciences and all</p>
<p class="calibre1">those most knotty volumes, unravelied by me, without aid from human</p>
<p class="calibre1">instruction; seeing I erred so foully, and with such sacrilegious</p>
<p class="calibre1">shamefulness, in the doctrine of piety? Or what hindrance was a far</p>
<p class="calibre1">slower wit to Thy little ones, since they departed not far from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee, that in the nest of Thy Church they might securely be fledged,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and nourish the wings of charity, by the food of a sound faith. O Lord</p>
<p class="calibre1">our God, under the shadow of Thy wings let us hope; protect us, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">carry us. Thou wilt carry us both when little, and even to hoar</p>
<p class="calibre1">hairs wilt Thou carry us; for our firmness, when it is Thou, then is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it firmness; but when our own, it is infirmity. Our good ever lives</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Thee; from which when we turn away, we are turned aside. Let us</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, O Lord, return, that we may not be overturned, because with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee our good lives without any decay, which good art Thou; nor need</p>
<p class="calibre1">we fear, lest there be no place whither to return, because we fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">from it: for through our absence, our mansion fell not-Thy eternity.</p>
