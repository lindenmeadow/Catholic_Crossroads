<h2 id="calibre_toc_8" class="calibre7">BOOK VII</h2><p class="calibre1">Deceased was now that my evil and abominable youth, and I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">passing into early manhood; the more defiled by vain things as I</p>
<p class="calibre1">grew in years, who could not imagine any substance, but such as is</p>
<p class="calibre1">wont to be seen with these eyes. I thought not of Thee, O God, under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the figure of a human body; since I began to hear aught of wisdom, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">always avoided this; and rejoiced to have found the same in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">faith of our spiritual mother, Thy Catholic Church. But what else to</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive of Thee I knew not. And I, a man, and such a man, sought to</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive of Thee the sovereign, only, true God; and I did in my inmost</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul believe that Thou wert incorruptible, and uninjurable, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchangeable; because though not knowing whence or how, yet I saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">plainly, and was sure, that that which may be corrupted must be</p>
<p class="calibre1">inferior to that which cannot; what could not be injured I preferred</p>
<p class="calibre1">unhesitatingly to what could receive injury; the unchangeable to</p>
<p class="calibre1">things subject to change. My heart passionately cried out against</p>
<p class="calibre1">all my phantoms, and with this one blow I sought to beat away from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye of my mind all that unclean troop which buzzed around it. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">to, being scarce put off, in the twinkling of an eye they gathered</p>
<p class="calibre1">again thick about me, flew against my face, and beclouded it; so</p>
<p class="calibre1">that though not under the form of the human body, yet was I</p>
<p class="calibre1">constrained to conceive of Thee (that incorruptible, uninjurable,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and unchangeable, which I preferred before the corruptible, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">injurable, and changeable) as being in space, whether infused into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world, or diffused infinitely without it. Because whatsoever I</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceived, deprived of this space, seemed to me nothing, yea</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether nothing, not even a void, as if a body were taken out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">its place, and the place should remain empty of any body at all, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth and water, air and heaven, yet would it remain a void place,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as it were a spacious nothing.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I then being thus gross-hearted, nor clear even to myself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever was not extended over certain spaces, nor diffused, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">condensed, nor swelled out, or did not or could not receive some of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these dimensions, I thought to be altogether nothing. For over such</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms as my eyes are wont to range, did my heart then range: nor yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">did I see that this same notion of the mind, whereby I formed those</p>
<p class="calibre1">very images, was not of this sort, and yet it could not have formed</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, had not itself been some great thing. So also did I endeavour to</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive of Thee, Life of my life, as vast, through infinite spaces on</p>
<p class="calibre1">every side penetrating the whole mass of the universe, and beyond</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, every way, through unmeasurable boundless spaces; so that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth should have Thee, the heaven have Thee, all things have Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and they be bounded in Thee, and Thou bounded nowhere. For that as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">body of this air which is above the earth, hindereth not the light</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the sun from passing through it, penetrating it, not by bursting or</p>
<p class="calibre1">by cutting, but by filling it wholly: so I thought the body not of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven, air, and sea only, but of the earth too, pervious to Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">so that in all its parts, the greatest as the smallest, it should</p>
<p class="calibre1">admit Thy presence, by a secret inspiration, within and without,</p>
<p class="calibre1">directing all things which Thou hast created. So I guessed, only as</p>
<p class="calibre1">unable to conceive aught else, for it was false. For thus should a</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater part of the earth contain a greater portion of Thee, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">less, a lesser: and all things should in such sort be full of Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the body of an elephant should contain more of Thee, than that of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a sparrow, by how much larger it is, and takes up more room; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thus shouldest Thou make the several portions of Thyself present</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto the several portions of the world, in fragments, large to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">large, petty to the petty. But such art not Thou. But not as yet hadst</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou enlightened my darkness.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was enough for me, Lord, to oppose to those deceived deceivers,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and dumb praters, since Thy word sounded not out of them; -that was</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough which long ago, while we were yet at Carthage, Nebridius used</p>
<p class="calibre1">to propound, at which all we that heard it were staggered: “That</p>
<p class="calibre1">said nation of darkness, which the Manichees are wont to set as an</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposing mass over against Thee, what could it have done unto Thee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadst Thou refused to fight with it? For, if they answered, ‘it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have done Thee some hurt,’ then shouldest Thou be subject to</p>
<p class="calibre1">injury and corruption: but if could do Thee no hurt,’ then was no</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason brought for Thy fighting with it; and fighting in such wise, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">that a certain portion or member of Thee, or offspring of Thy very</p>
<p class="calibre1">Substance, should he mingled with opposed powers, and natures not</p>
<p class="calibre1">created by Thee, and be by them so far corrupted and changed to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">worse, as to be turned from happiness into misery, and need</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistance, whereby it might be extricated and purified; and that this</p>
<p class="calibre1">offspring of Thy Substance was the soul, which being enthralled,</p>
<p class="calibre1">defiled, corrupted, Thy Word, free, pure, and whole, might relieve;</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Word itself being still corruptible because it was of one and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same Substance. So then, should they affirm Thee, whatsoever Thou art,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is, Thy Substance whereby Thou art, to be incorruptible, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">were all these sayings false and execrable; but if corruptible, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">very statement showed it to be false and revolting.” This argument</p>
<p class="calibre1">then of Nebridius sufficed against those who deserved wholly to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">vomited out of the overcharged stomach; for they had no escape,</p>
<p class="calibre1">without horrible blasphemy of heart and tongue, thus thinking and</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking of Thee.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I also as yet, although I held and was firmly persuaded that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou our Lord the true God, who madest not only our souls, but our</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies, and not only our souls and bodies, but all beings, and all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things, wert undefilable and unalterable, and in no degree mutable;</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet understood I not, clearly and without difficulty, the cause of</p>
<p class="calibre1">evil. And yet whatever it were, I perceived it was in such wise to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be sought out, as should not constrain me to believe the immutable God</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be mutable, lest I should become that evil I was seeking out. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sought it out then, thus far free from anxiety, certain of the untruth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of what these held, from whom I shrunk with my whole heart: for I saw,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that through enquiring the origin of evil, they were filled with evil,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that they preferred to think that Thy substance did suffer ill than</p>
<p class="calibre1">their own did commit it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I strained to perceive what I now heard, that free-will was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cause of our doing ill, and Thy just judgment of our suffering</p>
<p class="calibre1">ill. But I was not able clearly to discern it. So then endeavouring to</p>
<p class="calibre1">draw my soul’s vision out of that deep pit, I was again plunged</p>
<p class="calibre1">therein, and endeavouring often, I was plunged back as often. But this</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised me a little into Thy light, that I knew as well that I had a</p>
<p class="calibre1">will, as that I lived: when then I did will or nill any thing, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">most sure that no other than myself did will and nill: and I all but</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw that there was the cause of my sin. But what I did against my</p>
<p class="calibre1">will, I saw that I suffered rather than did, and I judged not to be my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fault, but my punishment; whereby, however, holding Thee to be just, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">speedily confessed myself to be not unjustly punished. But again I</p>
<p class="calibre1">said, Who made me? Did not my God, Who is not only good, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">goodness itself? Whence then came I to will evil and nill good, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I am thus justly punished? who set this in me, and ingrated</p>
<p class="calibre1">into me this plant of bitterness, seeing I was wholly formed by my</p>
<p class="calibre1">most sweet God? If the devil were the author, whence is that same</p>
<p class="calibre1">devil? And if he also by his own perverse will, of a good angel became</p>
<p class="calibre1">a devil, whence, again, came in him that evil will whereby he became a</p>
<p class="calibre1">devil, seeing the whole nature of angels was made by that most good</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creator? By these thoughts I was again sunk down and choked; yet not</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought down to that hell of error (where no man confesseth unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee), to think rather that Thou dost suffer ill, than that man doth</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For I was in such wise striving to find out the rest, as one who had</p>
<p class="calibre1">already found that the incorruptible must needs be better than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corruptible: and Thee therefore, whatsoever Thou wert, I confessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be incorruptible. For never soul was, nor shall be, able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive any thing which may be better than Thou, who art the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereign and the best good. But since most truly and certainly, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">incorruptible is preferable to the corruptible (as I did now prefer</p>
<p class="calibre1">it), then, wert Thou not incorruptible, I could in thought have</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived at something better than my God. Where then I saw the</p>
<p class="calibre1">incorruptible to be preferable to the corruptible, there ought I to</p>
<p class="calibre1">seek for Thee, and there observe “wherein evil itself was”; that is,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whence corruption comes, by which Thy substance can by no means be</p>
<p class="calibre1">impaired. For corruption does no ways impair our God; by no will, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">no necessity, by no unlooked-for chance: because He is God, and what</p>
<p class="calibre1">He wills is good, and Himself is that good; but to be corrupted is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">good. Nor art Thou against Thy will constrained to any thing, since</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy will is not greater than Thy power. But greater should it be, were</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyself greater than Thyself. For the will and power of God is God</p>
<p class="calibre1">Himself. And what can be unlooked-for by Thee, Who knowest all things?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor is there any nature in things, but Thou knowest it. And what</p>
<p class="calibre1">should we more say, “why that substance which God is should not be</p>
<p class="calibre1">corruptible,” seeing if it were so, it should not be God?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I sought “whence is evil,” and sought in an evil way; and saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">not the evil in my very search. I set now before the sight of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirit the whole creation, whatsoever we can see therein (as sea,</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth, air, stars, trees, mortal creatures); yea, and whatever in it</p>
<p class="calibre1">we do not see, as the firmament of heaven, all angels moreover, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">all the spiritual inhabitants thereof. But these very beings, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though they were bodies, did my fancy dispose in place, and I made one</p>
<p class="calibre1">great mass of Thy creation, distinguished as to the kinds of bodies;</p>
<p class="calibre1">some, real bodies, some, what myself had feigned for spirits. And this</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass I made huge, not as it was (which I could not know), but as I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought convenient, yet every way finite. But Thee, O Lord, I imagined</p>
<p class="calibre1">on every part environing and penetrating it, though every way</p>
<p class="calibre1">infinite: as if there were a sea, every where, and on every side,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through unmeasured space, one only boundless sea, and it contained</p>
<p class="calibre1">within it some sponge, huge, but bounded; that sponge must needs, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">all its parts, be filled from that unmeasurable sea: so conceived I</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy creation, itself finite, full of Thee, the Infinite; and I said,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Behold God, and behold what God hath created; and God is good, yea,</p>
<p class="calibre1">most mightily and incomparably better than all these: but yet He,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Good, created them good; and see how He environeth and fulfils</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. Where is evil then, and whence, and how crept it in hither? What</p>
<p class="calibre1">is its root, and what its seed? Or hath it no being? Why then fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">we and avoid what is not? Or if we fear it idly, then is that very</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear evil, whereby the soul is thus idly goaded and racked. Yea, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so much a greater evil, as we have nothing to fear, and yet do fear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore either is that evil which we fear, or else evil is, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">we fear. Whence is it then? seeing God, the Good, hath created all</p>
<p class="calibre1">these things good. He indeed, the greater and chiefest Good, hath</p>
<p class="calibre1">created these lesser goods; still both Creator and created, all are</p>
<p class="calibre1">good. Whence is evil? Or, was there some evil matter of which He made,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and formed, and ordered it, yet left something in it which He did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not convert into good? Why so then? Had He no might to turn and change</p>
<p class="calibre1">the whole, so that no evil should remain in it, seeing He is</p>
<p class="calibre1">All-mighty? Lastly, why would He make any thing at all of it, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not rather by the same All-mightiness cause it not to be at all? Or,</p>
<p class="calibre1">could it then be against His will? Or if it were from eternity, why</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffered He it so to be for infinite spaces of times past, and was</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased so long after to make something out of it? Or if He were</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly pleased now to effect somewhat, this rather should the</p>
<p class="calibre1">All-mighty have effected, that this evil matter should not be, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">He alone be, the whole, true, sovereign, and infinite Good. Or if it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not good that He who was good should not also frame and create</p>
<p class="calibre1">something that were good, then, that evil matter being taken away</p>
<p class="calibre1">and brought to nothing, He might form good matter, whereof to create</p>
<p class="calibre1">all things. For He should not be All-mighty, if He might not create</p>
<p class="calibre1">something good without the aid of that matter which Himself had not</p>
<p class="calibre1">created. These thoughts I revolved in my miserable heart,</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcharged with most gnawing cares, lest I should die ere I had found</p>
<p class="calibre1">the truth; yet was the faith of Thy Christ, our Lord and Saviour,</p>
<p class="calibre1">professed in the Church Catholic, firmly fixed in my heart, in many</p>
<p class="calibre1">points, indeed, as yet unformed, and fluctuating from the rule of</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctrine; yet did not my mind utterly leave it, but rather daily</p>
<p class="calibre1">took in more and more of it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this time also had I rejected the lying divinations and</p>
<p class="calibre1">impious dotages of the astrologers. Let Thine own mercies, out of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">very inmost soul, confess unto Thee for this also, O my God. For Thou,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou altogether (for who else calls us back from the death of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">errors, save the Life which cannot die, and the Wisdom which needing</p>
<p class="calibre1">no light enlightens the minds that need it, whereby the universe is</p>
<p class="calibre1">directed, down to the whirling leaves of trees?) -Thou madest</p>
<p class="calibre1">provision for my obstinacy wherewith I struggled against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vindicianus, an acute old man, and Nebridius, a young man of admirable</p>
<p class="calibre1">talents; the first vehemently affirming, and the latter often</p>
<p class="calibre1">(though with some doubtfulness) saying, “That there was no such art</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby to foresee things to come, but that men’s conjectures were a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort of lottery, and that out of many things which they said should</p>
<p class="calibre1">come to pass, some actually did, unawares to them who spake it, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">stumbled upon it, through their oft speaking.” Thou providedst then</p>
<p class="calibre1">a friend for me, no negligent consulter of the astrologers; nor yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">well skilled in those arts, but (as I said) a curious consulter with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, and yet knowing something, which he said he had heard of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">father, which how far it went to overthrow the estimation of that art,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he knew not. This man then, Firminus by name, having had a liberal</p>
<p class="calibre1">education, and well taught in Rhetoric, consulted me, as one very dear</p>
<p class="calibre1">to him, what, according to his socalled constellations, I thought on</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain affairs of his, wherein his worldly hopes had risen, and I,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who had herein now begun to incline towards Nebridius’ opinion, did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not altogether refuse to conjecture, and tell him what came into my</p>
<p class="calibre1">unresolved mind; but added, that I was now almost persuaded that these</p>
<p class="calibre1">were but empty and ridiculous follies. Thereupon he told me that his</p>
<p class="calibre1">father had been very curious in such books, and had a friend as</p>
<p class="calibre1">earnest in them as himself, who with joint study and conference fanned</p>
<p class="calibre1">the flame of their affections to these toys, so that they would</p>
<p class="calibre1">observe the moments whereat the very dumb animals, which bred about</p>
<p class="calibre1">their houses, gave birth, and then observed the relative position of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the heavens, thereby to make fresh experiments in this socalled</p>
<p class="calibre1">art. He said then that he had heard of his father, that what time</p>
<p class="calibre1">his mother was about to give birth to him, Firminus, a woman-servant</p>
<p class="calibre1">of that friend of his father’s was also with child, which could not</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape her master, who took care with most exact diligence to know the</p>
<p class="calibre1">births of his very puppies. And so it was that (the one for his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wife, and the other for his servant, with the most careful</p>
<p class="calibre1">observation, reckoning days, hours, nay, the lesser divisions of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours) both were delivered at the same instant; so that both were</p>
<p class="calibre1">constrained to allow the same constellations, even to the minutest</p>
<p class="calibre1">points, the one for his son, the other for his new-born slave. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">so soon as the women began to be in labour, they each gave notice to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the other what was fallen out in their houses, and had messengers</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready to send to one another so soon as they had notice of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual birth, of which they had easily provided, each in his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">province, to give instant intelligence. Thus then the messengers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the respective parties met, he averred, at such an equal distance from</p>
<p class="calibre1">either house that neither of them could make out any difference in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">position of the stars, or any other minutest points; and yet Firminus,</p>
<p class="calibre1">born in a high estate in his parents’ house, ran his course through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the gilded paths of life, was increased in riches, raised to</p>
<p class="calibre1">honours; whereas that slave continued to serve his masters, without</p>
<p class="calibre1">any relaxation of his yoke, as Firminus, who knew him, told me.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon hearing and believing these things, told by one of such</p>
<p class="calibre1">credibility, all that my resistance gave way; and first I</p>
<p class="calibre1">endeavoured to reclaim Firminus himself from that curiosity, by</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling him that upon inspecting his constellations, I ought if I were</p>
<p class="calibre1">to predict truly, to have seen in them parents eminent among their</p>
<p class="calibre1">neighbours, a noble family in its own city, high birth, good</p>
<p class="calibre1">education, liberal learning. But if that servant had consulted me upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same constellations, since they were his also, I ought again (to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell him too truly) to see in them a lineage the most abject, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">slavish condition, and every thing else utterly at variance with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">former. Whence then, if I spake the truth, I should, from the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">constellations, speak diversely, or if I spake the same, speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">falsely: thence it followed most certainly that whatever, upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">consideration of the constellations, was spoken truly, was spoken</p>
<p class="calibre1">not out of art, but chance; and whatever spoken falsely, was not out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of ignorance in the art, but the failure of the chance.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">An opening thus made, ruminating with myself on the like things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that no one of those dotards (who lived by such a trade, and whom I</p>
<p class="calibre1">longed to attack, and with derision to confute) might urge against</p>
<p class="calibre1">me that Firminus had informed me falsely, or his father him; I bent my</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts on those that are born twins, who for the most part come</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the womb so near one to other, that the small interval (how</p>
<p class="calibre1">much force soever in the nature of things folk may pretend it to have)</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot be noted by human observation, or be at all expressed in</p>
<p class="calibre1">those figures which the astrologer is to inspect, that he may</p>
<p class="calibre1">pronounce truly. Yet they cannot be true: for looking into the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">figures, he must have predicted the same of Esau and Jacob, whereas</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same happened not to them. Therefore he must speak falsely; or</p>
<p class="calibre1">if truly, then, looking into the same figures, he must not give the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same answer. Not by art, then, but by chance, would he speak truly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For Thou, O Lord, most righteous Ruler of the Universe, while</p>
<p class="calibre1">consulters and consulted know it not, dost by Thy hidden inspiration</p>
<p class="calibre1">effect that the consulter should hear what, according to the hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">deservings of souls, he ought to hear, out of the unsearchable depth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thy just judgment, to Whom let no man say, What is this? Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">that? Let him not so say, for he is man.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now then, O my Helper, hadst Thou loosed me from those fetters:</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I sought “whence is evil,” and found no way. But Thou sufferedst</p>
<p class="calibre1">me not by any fluctuations of thought to be carried away from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Faith whereby I believed Thee both to be, and Thy substance to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchangeable, and that Thou hast a care of, and wouldest judge men,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that in Christ, Thy Son, Our Lord, and the holy Scriptures,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which the authority of Thy Catholic Church pressed upon me, Thou hadst</p>
<p class="calibre1">set the way of man’s salvation, to that life which is to be after this</p>
<p class="calibre1">death. These things being safe and immovably settled in my mind, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sought anxiously “whence was evil?” What were the pangs of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">teeming heart, what groans, O my God! yet even there were Thine ears</p>
<p class="calibre1">open, and I knew it not; and when in silence I vehemently sought,</p>
<p class="calibre1">those silent contritions of my soul were strong cries unto Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">mercy. Thou knewest what I suffered, and no man. For, what was that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which was thence through my tongue distilled into the ears of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">most familiar friends? Did the whole tumult of my soul, for which</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither time nor utterance sufficed, reach them? Yet went up the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Thy hearing, all which I roared out from the groanings of my heart;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and my desire was before Thee, and the light of mine eyes was not with</p>
<p class="calibre1">me: for that was within, I without: nor was that confined to place,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but I was intent on things contained in place, but there found I no</p>
<p class="calibre1">resting-place, nor did they so receive me, that I could say, “It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough,” “it is well”: nor did they yet suffer me to turn back,</p>
<p class="calibre1">where it might be well enough with me. For to these things was I</p>
<p class="calibre1">superior, but inferior to Thee; and Thou art my true joy when</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjected to Thee, and Thou hadst subjected to me what Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">createdst below me. And this was the true temperament, and middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">region of my safety, to remain in Thy Image, and by serving Thee, rule</p>
<p class="calibre1">the body. But when I rose proudly against Thee, and ran against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord with my neck, with the thick bosses of my buckler, even these</p>
<p class="calibre1">inferior things were set above me, and pressed me down, and no where</p>
<p class="calibre1">was there respite or space of breathing. They met my sight on all</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides by heaps and troops, and in thought the images thereof presented</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves unsought, as I would return to Thee, as if they would say</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto me, “Whither goest thou, unworthy and defiled?” And these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things had grown out of my wound; for Thou “humbledst the proud like</p>
<p class="calibre1">one that is wounded,” and through my own swelling was I separated from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee; yea, my pride-swollen face closed up mine eyes.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Thou, Lord, abidest for ever, yet not for ever art Thou angry</p>
<p class="calibre1">with us; because Thou pitiest our dust and ashes, and it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasing in Thy sight to reform my deformities; and by inward goads</p>
<p class="calibre1">didst Thou rouse me, that I should be ill at ease, until Thou wert</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifested to my inward sight. Thus, by the secret hand of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">medicining was my swelling abated, and the troubled and bedimmed</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyesight of my mind, by the smarting anointings of healthful</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorrows, was from day to day healed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Thou, willing first to show me how Thou resistest the proud, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">givest grace unto the humble, and by how great an act of Thy mercy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hadst traced out to men the way of humility, in that Thy Word was</p>
<p class="calibre1">made flesh, and dwelt among men:- Thou procuredst for me, by means</p>
<p class="calibre1">of one puffed up with most unnatural pride, certain books of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Platonists, translated from Greek into Latin. And therein I read,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not indeed in the very words, but to the very same purpose, enforced</p>
<p class="calibre1">by many and divers reasons, that In the beginning was the Word, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Word was with God, and the Word was God: the Same was in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing made: that which was made by Him is life, and the life was the</p>
<p class="calibre1">light of men, and the light shineth in the darkness, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness comprehended it not. And that the soul of man, though it</p>
<p class="calibre1">bears witness to the light, yet itself is not that light; but the Word</p>
<p class="calibre1">of God, being God, is that true light that lighteth every man that</p>
<p class="calibre1">cometh into the world. And that He was in the world, and the world was</p>
<p class="calibre1">made by Him, and the world knew Him not. But, that He came unto His</p>
<p class="calibre1">own, and His own received Him not; but as many as received Him, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">them gave He power to become the sons of God, as many as believed in</p>
<p class="calibre1">His name; this I read not there.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again I read there, that God the Word was born not of flesh nor of</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of</p>
<p class="calibre1">God. But that the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, I read</p>
<p class="calibre1">not there. For I traced in those books that it was many and divers</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways said, that the Son was in the form of the Father, and thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">it not robbery to be equal with God, for that naturally He was the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Same Substance. But that He emptied Himself, taking the form of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">servant, being made in the likeness of men, and found in fashion as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a man, humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, and that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">death of the cross: wherefore God exalted Him from the dead, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave Him a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee</p>
<p class="calibre1">should how, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the earth; and that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ is in the glory of God the Father; those books have not. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">that before all times and above all times Thy Only-Begotten Son</p>
<p class="calibre1">remaineth unchangeable, coeternal with Thee, and that of His</p>
<p class="calibre1">fulness souls receive, that they may be blessed; and that by</p>
<p class="calibre1">participation of wisdom abiding in them, they are renewed, so as to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">wise, is there. But that in due time He died for the ungodly; and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou sparedst not Thine Only Son, but deliveredst Him for us all, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not there. For Thou hiddest these things from the wise, and revealedst</p>
<p class="calibre1">them to babes; that they that labour and are heavy laden might come</p>
<p class="calibre1">unto Him, and He refresh them, because He is meek and lowly in</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart; and the meek He directeth in judgment, and the gentle He</p>
<p class="calibre1">teacheth His ways, beholding our lowliness and trouble, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgiving all our sins. But such as are lifted up in the lofty walk of</p>
<p class="calibre1">some would-be sublimer learning, hear not Him, saying, Learn of Me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your</p>
<p class="calibre1">souls. Although they knew God, yet they glorify Him not as God, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">are thankful, but wax vain in their thoughts; and their foolish</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart is darkened; professing that they were wise, they became fools.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And therefore did I read there also, that they had changed the glory</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Thy incorruptible nature into idols and divers shapes, into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">likeness of the image of corruptible man, and birds, and beasts, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">creeping things; namely, into that Egyptian food for which Esau lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">his birthright, for that Thy first-born people worshipped the head</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a four-footed beast instead of Thee; turning in heart back</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards Egypt; and bowing Thy image, their own soul, before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">image of a calf that eateth hay. These things found I here, but I</p>
<p class="calibre1">fed not on them. For it pleased Thee, O Lord, to take away the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reproach of diminution from Jacob, that the elder should serve the</p>
<p class="calibre1">younger: and Thou calledst the Gentiles into Thine inheritance. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had come to Thee from among the Gentiles; and I set my mind upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gold which Thou willedst Thy people to take from Egypt, seeing Thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was, wheresoever it were. And to the Athenians Thou saidst by Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apostle, that in Thee we live, move, and have our being, as one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their own poets had said. And verily these books came from thence. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">I set not my mind on the idols of Egypt, whom they served with Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">gold, who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and</p>
<p class="calibre1">served the creature more than the Creator.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And being thence admonished to return to myself, I entered even into</p>
<p class="calibre1">my inward self, Thou being my Guide: and able I was, for Thou wert</p>
<p class="calibre1">become my Helper. And I entered and beheld with the eye of my soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">(such as it was), above the same eye of my soul, above my mind, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Light Unchangeable. Not this ordinary light, which all flesh may</p>
<p class="calibre1">look upon, nor as it were a greater of the same kind, as though the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brightness of this should be manifold brighter, and with its greatness</p>
<p class="calibre1">take up all space. Not such was this light, but other, yea, far</p>
<p class="calibre1">other from these. Nor was it above my soul, as oil is above water, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet as heaven above earth: but above to my soul, because It made me;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I below It, because I was made by It. He that knows the Truth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows what that Light is; and he that knows It, knows eternity. Love</p>
<p class="calibre1">knoweth it. O Truth Who art Eternity! and Love Who art Truth! and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eternity Who art Love! Thou art my God, to Thee do I sigh night and</p>
<p class="calibre1">day. Thee when I first knew, Thou liftedst me up, that I might see</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was what I might see, and that I was not yet such as to see. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou didst beat back the weakness of my sight, streaming forth Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">beams of light upon me most strongly, and I trembled with love and</p>
<p class="calibre1">awe: and I perceived myself to be far off from Thee, in the region</p>
<p class="calibre1">of unlikeness, as if I heard this Thy voice from on high: “I am the</p>
<p class="calibre1">food of grown men, grow, and thou shalt feed upon Me; nor shalt thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">convert Me, like the food of thy flesh into thee, but thou shalt be</p>
<p class="calibre1">converted into Me.” And I learned, that Thou for iniquity chastenest</p>
<p class="calibre1">man, and Thou madest my soul to consume away like a spider. And I</p>
<p class="calibre1">said, “Is Truth therefore nothing because it is not diffused through</p>
<p class="calibre1">space finite or infinite?” And Thou criedst to me from afar: “Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">verily, I AM that I AM.” And I heard, as the heart heareth, nor had</p>
<p class="calibre1">I room to doubt, and I should sooner doubt that I live than that Truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">is not, which is clearly seen, being understood by those things</p>
<p class="calibre1">which are made. And I beheld the other things below Thee, and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceived that they neither altogether are, nor altogether are not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">for they are, since they are from Thee, but are not, because they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are not what Thou art. For that truly is which remains unchangeably.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is good then for me to hold fast unto God; for if I remain not in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Him, I cannot in myself; but He remaining in Himself, reneweth all</p>
<p class="calibre1">things. And Thou art the Lord my God, since Thou standest not in</p>
<p class="calibre1">need of my goodness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it was manifested unto me, that those things be good which yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">are corrupted; which neither were they sovereignly good, nor unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">they were good could he corrupted: for if sovereignly good, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were incorruptible, if not good at all, there were nothing in them</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be corrupted. For corruption injures, but unless it diminished</p>
<p class="calibre1">goodness, it could not injure. Either then corruption injures not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which cannot be; or which is most certain, all which is corrupted is</p>
<p class="calibre1">deprived of good. But if they he deprived of all good, they shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">cease to be. For if they shall be, and can now no longer he corrupted,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they shall be better than before, because they shall abide</p>
<p class="calibre1">incorruptibly. And what more monstrous than to affirm things to become</p>
<p class="calibre1">better by losing all their good? Therefore, if they shall be</p>
<p class="calibre1">deprived of all good, they shall no longer be. So long therefore as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they are, they are good: therefore whatsoever is, is good. That evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">then which I sought, whence it is, is not any substance: for were it a</p>
<p class="calibre1">substance, it should be good. For either it should be an incorruptible</p>
<p class="calibre1">substance, and so a chief good: or a corruptible substance; which</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless it were good, could not be corrupted. I perceived therefore,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and it was manifested to me that Thou madest all things good, nor is</p>
<p class="calibre1">there any substance at all, which Thou madest not; and for that Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">madest not all things equal, therefore are all things; because each is</p>
<p class="calibre1">good, and altogether very good, because our God made all things very</p>
<p class="calibre1">good.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And to Thee is nothing whatsoever evil: yea, not only to Thee, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">also to Thy creation as a whole, because there is nothing without,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which may break in, and corrupt that order which Thou hast appointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. But in the parts thereof some things, because unharmonising with</p>
<p class="calibre1">other some, are accounted evil: whereas those very things harmonise</p>
<p class="calibre1">with others, and are good; and in themselves are good. And all these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things which harmonise not together, do yet with the inferior part,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which we call Earth, having its own cloudy and windy sky harmonising</p>
<p class="calibre1">with it. Far be it then that I should say, “These things should not</p>
<p class="calibre1">be”: for should I see nought but these, I should indeed long for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">better; but still must even for these alone praise Thee; for that Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">art to be praised, do show from the earth, dragons, and all deeps,</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire, hail, snow, ice, and stormy wind, which fulfil Thy word;</p>
<p class="calibre1">mountains, and all hills, fruitful trees, and all cedars; beasts,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and all cattle, creeping things, and flying fowls; kings of the earth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and all people, princes, and all judges of the earth; young men and</p>
<p class="calibre1">maidens, old men and young, praise Thy Name. But when, from heaven,</p>
<p class="calibre1">these praise Thee, praise Thee, our God, in the heights all Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">angels, all Thy hosts, sun and moon, all the stars and light, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heaven of heavens, and the waters that be above the heavens, praise</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy Name; I did not now long for things better, because I conceived of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all: and with a sounder judgment I apprehended that the things above</p>
<p class="calibre1">were better than these below, but altogether better than those above</p>
<p class="calibre1">by themselves.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no soundness in them, whom aught of Thy creation</p>
<p class="calibre1">displeaseth: as neither in me, when much which Thou hast made,</p>
<p class="calibre1">displeased me. And because my soul durst not be displeased at my</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, it would fain not account that Thine, which displeased it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence it had gone into the opinion of two substances, and had no rest,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but talked idly. And returning thence, it had made to itself a God,</p>
<p class="calibre1">through infinite measures of all space; and thought it to be Thee, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed it in its heart; and had again become the temple of its own</p>
<p class="calibre1">idol, to Thee abominable. But after Thou hadst soothed my head,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unknown to me, and closed mine eyes that they should not behold</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanity, I ceased somewhat of my former self, and my frenzy was</p>
<p class="calibre1">lulled to sleep; and I awoke in Thee, and saw Thee infinite, but in</p>
<p class="calibre1">another way, and this sight was not derived from the flesh.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I looked back on other things; and I saw that they owed their</p>
<p class="calibre1">being to Thee; and were all bounded in Thee: but in a different way;</p>
<p class="calibre1">not as being in space; but because Thou containest all things in Thine</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand in Thy Truth; and all things are true so far as they nor is there</p>
<p class="calibre1">any falsehood, unless when that is thought to be, which is not. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">I saw that all things did harmonise, not with their places only, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">with their seasons. And that Thou, who only art Eternal, didst not</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin to work after innumerable spaces of times spent; for that all</p>
<p class="calibre1">spaces of times, both which have passed, and which shall pass, neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">go nor come, but through Thee, working and abiding.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I perceived and found it nothing strange, that bread which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasant to a healthy palate is loathsome to one distempered: and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sore eyes light is offensive, which to the sound is delightful. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy righteousness displeaseth the wicked; much more the viper and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reptiles, which Thou hast created good, fitting in with the inferior</p>
<p class="calibre1">portions of Thy Creation, with which the very wicked also fit in;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that the more, by how much they be unlike Thee; but with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">superior creatures, by how much they become more like to Thee. And I</p>
<p class="calibre1">enquired what iniquity was, and found it to be substance, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">perversion of the will, turned aside from Thee, O God, the Supreme,</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards these lower things, and casting out its bowels, and puffed</p>
<p class="calibre1">up outwardly.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I wondered that I now loved Thee, and no phantasm for Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet did I not press on to enjoy my God; but was borne up to Thee</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Thy beauty, and soon borne down from Thee by mine own weight,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinking with sorrow into these inferior things. This weight was carnal</p>
<p class="calibre1">custom. Yet dwelt there with me a remembrance of Thee; nor did I any</p>
<p class="calibre1">way doubt that there was One to whom I might cleave, but that I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not yet such as to cleave to Thee: for that the body which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">corrupted presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle</p>
<p class="calibre1">weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things. And most</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain I was, that Thy invisible works from the creation of the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy eternal power and Godhead. For examining whence it was that I</p>
<p class="calibre1">admired the beauty of bodies celestial or terrestrial; and what</p>
<p class="calibre1">aided me in judging soundly on things mutable, and pronouncing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This ought to be thus, this not”; examining, I say, whence it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I so judged, seeing I did so judge, I had found the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchangeable and true Eternity of Truth above my changeable mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And thus by degrees I passed from bodies to the soul, which through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bodily senses perceives; and thence to its inward faculty, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">which the bodily senses represent things external, whitherto reach the</p>
<p class="calibre1">faculties of beasts; and thence again to the reasoning faculty, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">which what is received from the senses of the body is referred to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">judged. Which finding itself also to be in me a thing variable, raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself up to its own understanding, and drew away my thoughts from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">power of habit, withdrawing itself from those troops of</p>
<p class="calibre1">contradictory phantasms; that so it might find what that light was</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby it was bedewed, when, without all doubting, it cried out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That the unchangeable was to be preferred to the changeable”;</p>
<p class="calibre1">whence also it knew That Unchangeable, which, unless it had in some</p>
<p class="calibre1">way known, it had had no sure ground to prefer it to the changeable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And thus with the flash of one trembling glance it arrived at THAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">WHICH IS. And then I saw Thy invisible things understood by the things</p>
<p class="calibre1">which are made. But I could not fix my gaze thereon; and my</p>
<p class="calibre1">infirmity being struck back, I was thrown again on my wonted habits,</p>
<p class="calibre1">carrying along with me only a loving memory thereof, and a longing for</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I had, as it were, perceived the odour of, but was not yet able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to feed on.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I sought a way of obtaining strength sufficient to enjoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thee; and found it not, until I embraced that Mediator betwixt God and</p>
<p class="calibre1">men, the Man Christ Jesus, who is over all, God blessed for</p>
<p class="calibre1">evermore, calling unto me, and saying, I am the way, the truth, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the life, and mingling that food which I was unable to receive, with</p>
<p class="calibre1">our flesh. For, the Word was made flesh, that Thy wisdom, whereby Thou</p>
<p class="calibre1">createdst all things, might provide milk for our infant state. For I</p>
<p class="calibre1">did not hold to my Lord Jesus Christ, I, humbled, to the Humble; nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew I yet whereto His infirmity would guide us. For Thy Word, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eternal Truth, far above the higher parts of Thy Creation, raises up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the subdued unto Itself: but in this lower world built for Itself a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowly habitation of our clay, whereby to abase from themselves such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be subdued, and bring them over to Himself; allaying their</p>
<p class="calibre1">swelling, and tomenting their love; to the end they might go on no</p>
<p class="calibre1">further in self-confidence, but rather consent to become weak,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing before their feet the Divinity weak by taking our coats of</p>
<p class="calibre1">skin; and wearied, might cast themselves down upon It, and It</p>
<p class="calibre1">rising, might lift them up.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I thought otherwise; conceiving only of my Lord Christ as of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man of excellent wisdom, whom no one could be equalled unto;</p>
<p class="calibre1">especially, for that being wonderfully born of a Virgin, He seemed, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">conformity therewith, through the Divine care for us, to have attained</p>
<p class="calibre1">that great eminence of authority, for an ensample of despising</p>
<p class="calibre1">things temporal for the obtaining of immortality. But what mystery</p>
<p class="calibre1">there lay in “The Word was made flesh,” I could not even imagine. Only</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had learnt out of what is delivered to us in writing of Him that</p>
<p class="calibre1">He did eat, and drink, sleep, walk, rejoiced in spirit, was sorrowful,</p>
<p class="calibre1">discoursed; that flesh did not cleave by itself unto Thy Word, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the human soul and mind. All know this who know the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchangeableness of Thy Word, which I now knew, as far as I could, nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">did I at all doubt thereof. For, now to move the limbs of the body</p>
<p class="calibre1">by will, now not, now to be moved by some affection, now not, now to</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliver wise sayings through human signs, now to keep silence,</p>
<p class="calibre1">belong to soul and mind subject to variation. And should these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things be falsely written of Him, all the rest also would risk the</p>
<p class="calibre1">charge, nor would there remain in those books any saving faith for</p>
<p class="calibre1">mankind. Since then they were written truly, I acknowledged a</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfect man to be in Christ; not the body of a man only, nor, with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">body, a sensitive soul without a rational, but very man; whom, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only as being a form of Truth, but for a certain great excellence of</p>
<p class="calibre1">human nature and a more perfect participation of wisdom, I judged to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be preferred before others. But Alypius imagined the Catholics to</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe God to be so clothed with flesh, that besides God and flesh,</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was no soul at all in Christ, and did not think that a human</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind was ascribed to Him. And because he was well persuaded that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions recorded of Him could only be performed by a vital and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rational creature, he moved the more slowly towards the Christian</p>
<p class="calibre1">Faith. But understanding afterwards that this was the error of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apollinarian heretics, he joyed in and was conformed to the Catholic</p>
<p class="calibre1">Faith. But somewhat later, I confess, did I learn how in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying, The Word was made flesh, the Catholic truth is distinguished</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the falsehood of Photinus. For the rejection of heretics makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">the tenets of Thy Church and sound doctrine to stand out more clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For there must also be heresies, that the approved may be made</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifest among the weak.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But having then read those books of the Platonists, and thence</p>
<p class="calibre1">been taught to search for incorporeal truth, I saw Thy invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">things, understood by those things which are made; and though cast</p>
<p class="calibre1">back, I perceived what that was which through the darkness of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind I was hindered from contemplating, being assured “That Thou wert,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and wert infinite, and yet not diffused in space, finite or</p>
<p class="calibre1">infinite; and that Thou truly art Who art the same ever, in no part</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor motion varying; and that all other things are from Thee, on this</p>
<p class="calibre1">most sure ground alone, that they are.” Of these things I was assured,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet too unsure to enjoy Thee. I prated as one well skilled; but had</p>
<p class="calibre1">I not sought Thy way in Christ our Saviour, I had proved to be, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">skilled, but killed. For now I had begun to wish to seem wise, being</p>
<p class="calibre1">filled with mine own punishment, yet I did not mourn, but rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">scorn, puffed up with knowledge. For where was that charity building</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the foundation of humility, which is Christ Jesus? or when should</p>
<p class="calibre1">these books teach me it? Upon these, I believe, Thou therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">willedst that I should fall, before I studied Thy Scriptures, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it might be imprinted on my memory how I was affected by them; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that afterwards when my spirits were tamed through Thy books, and my</p>
<p class="calibre1">wounds touched by Thy healing fingers, I might discern and distinguish</p>
<p class="calibre1">between presumption and confession; between those who saw whither they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were to go, yet saw not the way, and the way that leadeth not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold only but to dwell in the beatific country. For had I first been</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed in Thy Holy Scriptures, and hadst Thou in the familiar use of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them grown sweet unto me, and had I then fallen upon those other</p>
<p class="calibre1">volumes, they might perhaps have withdrawn me from the solid ground of</p>
<p class="calibre1">piety, or, had I continued in that healthful frame which I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">thence imbibed, I might have thought that it might have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained by the study of those books alone.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most eagerly then did I seize that venerable writing of Thy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit; and chiefly the Apostle Paul. Whereupon those difficulties</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanished away, wherein he once seemed to me to contradict himself, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the text of his discourse not to agree with the testimonies of the Law</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the Prophets. And the face of that pure word appeared to me one</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the same; and I learned to rejoice with trembling. So I began; and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever truth I had read in those other books, I found here amid</p>
<p class="calibre1">the praise of Thy Grace; that whoso sees, may not so glory as if he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had not received, not only what he sees, but also that he sees (for</p>
<p class="calibre1">what hath he, which he hath not received?), and that he may be not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only admonished to behold Thee, who art ever the same, but also</p>
<p class="calibre1">healed, to hold Thee; and that he who cannot see afar off, may yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk on the way, whereby he may arrive, and behold, and hold Thee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For, though a man be delighted with the law of God after the inner</p>
<p class="calibre1">man, what shall he do with that other law in his members which warreth</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the law of his mind, and bringeth him into captivity to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">law of sin which is in his members? For, Thou art righteous, O Lord,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but we have sinned and committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy hand is grown heavy upon us, and we are justly delivered over unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">that ancient sinner, the king of death; because he persuaded our</p>
<p class="calibre1">will to be like his will whereby he abode not in Thy truth. What shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">wretched man do? who shall deliver him from the body of his death, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">only Thy Grace, through Jesus Christ our Lord, whom Thou hast begotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">coeternal, and formedst in the beginning of Thy ways, in whom the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prince of this world found nothing worthy of death, yet killed he Him;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the handwriting, which was contrary to us, was blotted out? This</p>
<p class="calibre1">those writings contain not. Those pages present not the image of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this piety, the tears of confession, Thy sacrifice, a troubled spirit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">a broken and a contrite heart, the salvation of the people, the Bridal</p>
<p class="calibre1">City, the earnest of the Holy Ghost, the Cup of our Redemption. No man</p>
<p class="calibre1">sings there, Shall not my soul be submitted unto God? for of Him</p>
<p class="calibre1">cometh my salvation. For He is my God and my salvation, my guardian, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall no more be moved. No one there hears Him call, Come unto Me, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye that labour. They scorn to learn of Him, because He is meek and</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowly in heart; for these things hast Thou hid from the wise and</p>
<p class="calibre1">prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. For it is one thing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the mountain’s shaggy top to see the land of peace, and to find</p>
<p class="calibre1">no way thither; and in vain to essay through ways unpassable,</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposed and beset by fugitives and deserters, under their captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">the lion and the dragon: and another to keep on the way that leads</p>
<p class="calibre1">thither, guarded by the host of the heavenly General; where they spoil</p>
<p class="calibre1">not who have deserted the heavenly army; for they avoid it, as very</p>
<p class="calibre1">torment. These things did wonderfully sink into my bowels, when I read</p>
<p class="calibre1">that least of Thy Apostles, and had meditated upon Thy works, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">trembled exceedingly.</p>
