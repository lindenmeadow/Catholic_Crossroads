<p class="calibre1">{Transcriber's	Note:	This	book	is	commonly	known	as	"The	Baltimore Catechism	No.	3"	and	is	part	of	a	four	volume	e-text	collection.	See	the	author's note	below	for	the	background	and	purpose	of	the	series.	This	e-text	collection	is substantially	based	on	files	generously	provided	by	http://www.catholic.net/	with some	missing	material	transcribed	and	added	for	this	release.	Transcriber's	notes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>in	this	series	are	placed	within	braces,	and	usually	prefixed	"T.N.:".}</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a><b class="calibre3">NOTE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">These	Catechisms	of	the	Baltimore	Series	are	arranged	on	a	progressive	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	00	gives	the	Prayers	and	Acts	to	be	learned	before	the	study	of	the Catechisms	begins:—No.	0	contains	one	half	the	questions	of	No.	1;	No.	1	half the	questions	of	No.	2;	No.	2	one-third	the	questions	of	No.	3,	and	No.	4	(an Explanation	of	the	Baltimore	Catechism)	furnishes	much	additional	information with	copious	explanations	and	examples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	same	questions	bear	the	same	numbers	throughout	the	series,	and	their wording	is	identical.	The	different	sizes	of	type	make	the	Catechisms	more suitable	to	their	respective	grades,	smaller	children	usually	requiring	larger	print. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apart	from	its	educational	advantages,	the	progressive	plan	aims	at	lessening	the expense	in	providing	children	with	Catechisms,	by	furnishing	just	what	is necessary	for	each	grade;	it	aims	also	at	encouraging	the	children	to	learn,	by affording	opportunity	for	promotion	from	book	to	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	Catechisms	are	intended	to	furnish	a	complete	course	of	religious instruction,	when,	used	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	00	for	Prayer	classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	0	for	Confession	classes	and	certain	adults. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	1	for	First	Communion	classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	2	for	Confirmation	classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	3	for	two	years'	course	for	Post-Confirmation	classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	4	for	Teachers	and	Teachers'	Training	classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a><b class="calibre3">PREFACE	TO	NO.	3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	been	requested	by	several	priests	to	prepare	an	abridgment	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Explanation	of	the	Baltimore	Catechism"	that	would	be	suitable	as	a	classbook for	children	who	have	been	confirmed	or	who	have	completed	the	study	of	the Baltimore	Catechism	No.	2.	The	"Explanation"	itself	contains	more	matter	than some	of	these	children	can	master	and	it	costs	a	little	more	than	many	of	them can	afford	to	pay.	I	have,	therefore,	selected	from	the	list	given	in	the	back	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Explanation"	a	large	number	of	the	more	practical	and	important	questions,	to which	I	have	added	others,	with	answers,	as	full,	brief	and	simple	as	the	matter will	permit.	These	questions	and	answers	are	added	to	those	of	the	Baltimore Catechism	No.	2,	but	with	such	distinction	in	type	that	all	may	see	they	are	not	a part	of	the	Catechism	prepared	by	the	Council,	but	only	a	development	of	its meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">{T.N.:	It	is	not	practical	below	to	mimic	"such	distinction	in	type"	that	exists	in the	original	book.	To	indicate	the	questions	prepared	by	the	Council	I	have added	in	braces	their	corresponding	numbers	from	Baltimore	Catechism	No.	2. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	example,	question	130	below	is	question	1	in	Baltimore	Catechism	No.	2.	Fr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kinkead's	supplemental	questions	lack	this	double	numbering.}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever	questions	on	the	same	subject	are	repeated	in	the	book	their	object	is to	bring	out	some	new	point	or	to	show	their	connection	with	the	subject-matter there	explained. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Our	Father,	who	art	in	heaven,	hallowed	be	Thy	name.	Thy	kingdom	come;	Thy will	be	done	on	earth	as	it	is	in	heaven.	Give	us	this	day	our	daily	bread;	and forgive	us	our	trespasses	as	we	forgive	those	who	trespass	against	us;	and	lead	us not	into	temptation,	but	deliver	us	from	evil.	Amen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Angelical	Salutation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hail	Mary,	full	of	grace!	the	Lord	is	with	thee:	blessed	art	thou amongst	women,	and	blessed	is	the	fruit	of	thy	womb,	Jesus.	Holy	Mary, Mother	of	God,	pray	for	us	sinners,	now	and	at	the	hour	of	our	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Apostles'	Creed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	believe	in	God,	the	Father	Almighty,	Creator	of	heaven	and	earth;	and	in	Jesus Christ,	His	only	Son,	our	Lord;	who	was	conceived	by	the	Holy	Ghost,	born	of the	Virgin	Mary,	suffered	under	Pontius	Pilate,	was	crucified;	died,	and	was buried.	He	descended	into	hell;	the	third	day	He	arose	again	from	the	dead;	He ascended	into	heaven,	sitteth	at	the	right	hand	of	God,	the	Father	Almighty;	from thence	He	shall	come	to	judge	the	living	and	the	dead.	I	believe	in	the	Holy Ghost,	the	Holy	Catholic	Church,	the	communion	of	Saints,	the	forgiveness	of sins,	the	resurrection	of	the	body,	and	the	life	everlasting.	Amen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Confiteor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	confess	to	Almighty	God,	to	blessed	Mary,	ever	Virgin,	to	blessed	Michael	the Archangel,	to	blessed	John	the	Baptist,	to	the	holy	Apostles	Peter	and	Paul,	and to	all	the	Saints,	that	I	have	sinned	exceedingly	in	thought,	word	and	deed, through	my	fault,	through	my	fault,	through	my	most	grievous	fault.	Therefore,	I beseech	blessed	Mary,	ever	Virgin,	blessed	Michael	the	Archangel,	blessed	John the	Baptist,	the	holy	Apostles	Peter	and	Paul,	and	all	the	Saints,	to	pray	to	the Lord	our	God	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May	the	Almighty	God	have	mercy	on	me,	and	forgive	me	my	sins,	and	bring me	to	everlasting	life.	Amen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">An	Act	of	Faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O	my	God!	I	firmly	believe	that	Thou	art	one	God	in	three	Divine	persons, Father,	Son,	and	Holy	Ghost;	I	believe	that	Thy	Divine	Son	became	man,	and died	for	our	sins,	and	that	he	will	come	to	judge	the	living	and	the	dead.	I	believe these	and	all	the	truths	which	the	Holy	Catholic	Church	teaches,	because	Thou hast	revealed	them,	who	canst	neither	deceive	nor	be	deceived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	Act	of	Hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O	my	God!	relying	on	Thy	infinite	goodness	and	promises,	I	hope	to	obtain pardon	of	my	sins,	the	help	of	Thy	grace,	and	life	everlasting,	through	the	merits of	Jesus	Christ,	my	Lord	and	Redeemer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	Act	of	Love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O	my	God!	I	love	Thee	above	all	things,	with	my	whole	heart	and	soul,	because Thou	art	all-good	and	worthy	of	all	love.	I	love	my	neighbor	as	myself	for	the love	of	Thee.	I	forgive	all	who	have	injured	me,	and	ask	pardon	of	all	whom	I have	injured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	Act	of	Contrition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O	my	God!	I	am	heartily	sorry	for	having	offended	Thee,	and	I	detest	all	my sins,	because	I	dread	the	loss	of	heaven	and	the	pains	of	hell;	but	most	of	all because	they	offend	Thee,	my	God,	who	art	all-good	and	deserving	of	all	my love.	I	firmly	resolve,	with	the	help	of	Thy	grace,	to	confess	my	sins,	to	do penance,	and	to	amend	my	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Blessing	before	Meals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">+	Bless	us,	O	Lord!	and	these	Thy	gifts,	which	we	are	about	to	receive	from	Thy bounty,	through	Christ	our	Lord.	Amen. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE	LORD'S	PRAYER. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1.	Say	the	Lord's	Prayer.	A.	Our	Father,	who	art	in	heaven,	hallowed	be	Thy name;	Thy	kingdom	come;	Thy	will	be	done	on	earth	as	it	is	in	heaven.	Give	us this	day	our	daily	bread;	and	forgive	us	our	trespasses	as	we	forgive	those	who trespass	against	us;	and	lead	us	not	into	temptation,	but	deliver	us	from	evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	2.	Who	made	the	Lord's	Prayer?	A.	Our	Lord	Himself	made	the	Lord's	Prayer for	the	use	of	His	disciples	and	of	all	the	faithful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	3.	Why	is	the	"Our	Father"	the	most	excellent	of	all	Prayers? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	"Our	Father"	is	the	most	excellent	of	all	prayers	because	Our Lord	Himself	made	it	and	because	its	petitions	ask	for	all	we	can	need for	soul	or	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	4.	How	is	the	Lord's	Prayer	divided?	A.	The	Lord's	Prayer	is	divided	into seven	requests	or	petitions.	Three	of	these	petitions	refer	to	God's	honor	and glory,	and	the	remaining	four	to	our	corporeal	or	spiritual	wants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	5.	Whom	do	we	address	as	"Our	Father"	when	we	say	the	Lord's	Prayer? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	When	we	say	"Our	Father"	in	the	Lord's	Prayer	we	address	Almighty God,	Father,	Son	and	Holy	Ghost	united	in	the	adorable	Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	6.	Why	do	we	say	"our"	and	not	"my"	Father?	A.	We	say	"our"	and	not	"my" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Father	to	remind	us	that	through	our	creation	and	redemption,	we	are	all members	of	the	great	human	family	of	which	God	is	the	Father;	and	that	we should	pray	for	and	help	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>Q.	7.	Why	do	we	call	God	Father?	A.	We	call	God	Father	because	He	does	for	us what	a	good	father	should	do	for	his	children.	He	gives	us	our	existence;	He protects	us;	He	provides	for	us	and	teaches	us;	and	because	the	name	of	"Father" </p>
<p class="calibre1">fills	us	with	love	and	reverence	for	him,	and	with	confidence	in	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	8.	Why	do	we	say	"Who	art	in	heaven"	if	God	be	everywhere?	A.	We	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">"who	art	in	heaven"	to	put	us	in	mind	(1)	that	heaven	is	our	true	home	for	which we	were	created;	(2)	that	in	heaven	we	shall	see	God	face	to	face	as	He	is;	(3) that	heaven	is	the	place	where	God	will	be	for	all	eternity,	with	the	blessed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	9.	What	does	"Hallowed	be	Thy	Name"	mean?	A.	Hallowed	means	set	apart for	a	holy	or	sacred	use,	and	thus	comes	to	mean	treated	or	praised	as	holy	or sacred.	"Thy	name"	means	God	Himself	and	all	relating	to	Him,	and	by	this petition	we	ask	that	God	may	be	known,	loved	and	served	by	all. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	63.	What	is	death?	A.	Death	in	man	is	caused	by	the	separation	of	the	soul from	the	body,	for	Adam	was	made	a	living	being	by	the	union	of	his	soul	and body. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	78.	To	whom	do	we	usually	give	the	name	of	"Saints"?	A.	We	usually	apply the	name	of	"Saints"	to	those	only	whom	the	Church	has	Canonized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	79.	What	is	the	Canonization	of	a	Saint?	A.	Canonization	is	a	solemn ceremony	by	which	the	Church	declares	that	a	certain	person,	now	dead,	was remarkable	for	extraordinary	holiness	while	on	earth,	and	is	now	in	heaven worthy	of	our	veneration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	80.	How	does	the	Canonization	of	a	Saint	take	place?	A.	In	the	Canonization of	a	Saint	(1)	the	accounts	of	the	person's	holy	life,	heroic	virtue,	and	miracles are	collected	and	sent	to	the	Holy	See;	(2)	those	accounts	are	examined	by	the Holy	Father	or	his	cardinals,	and,	if	found	to	be	true	and	sufficient,	(3)	the	Saint is	Canonized	or	perhaps	only	beatified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	81.	What	is	the	difference	between	the	honors	conferred	on	a	person	by beatification	and	Canonization?	A.	Beatification	limits	the	honor	to	be	given	to the	beatified	by	restricting	it	to	certain	places	or	persons;	whereas	Canonization is	the	highest	honor	and	permits	all	to	venerate	the	Saint	everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	82.	Why	does	the	Church	Canonize	Saints?	A.	The	Church	Canonizes	Saints (1)	to	honor	them,	and	(2)	to	make	us	certain	that	they	are	in	heaven,	and	may, therefore,	be	invoked	in	our	prayers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>Q.	83.	Can	the	Church	err	in	the	Canonization	of	a	Saint? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	cannot	err	in	matters	of	faith	or	morals,	and	the Canonization	of	a	Saint	is	a	matter	of	faith	and	morals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	84.	What	is	the	difference	between	a	Saint	and	an	Angel?	A.	The	Saints	lived upon	the	earth	in	bodies	like	our	own.	The	Angels	never	inhabited	the	earth, though	they	visit	it	and	remain	for	a	time	with	us.	They	have	not	now	and	never will	have	bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	85.	Through	what	means	may	we	obtain	the	"forgiveness	of	sins"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	may	obtain	the	"forgiveness	of	sins"	especially	through	the Sacraments	of	Baptism	and	Penance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	86.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"resurrection	of	the	body"?	A.	By	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"resurrection	of	the	body"	we	mean	that	the	bodies	of	the	dead	shall	be	restored to	life,	rise	again	on	the	last	day,	and	be	united	to	the	souls	from	which	they	were separated	by	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	87.	How	is	the	resurrection	possible	when	the	bodies	are	reduced	to	ashes	and mingled	with	the	soil?	A.	The	resurrection	is	possible	to	God,	who	can	do	all things,	and	who,	having	created	the	bodies	out	of	nothing	in	the	beginning,	can easily	collect	and	put	together	their	scattered	parts	by	an	act	of	His	all-powerful will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	88.	What	does	"life	everlasting"	mean?	A.	"Life	everlasting"	means	endless happiness	in	heaven;	as	endless	misery	in	hell	may	be	called	"everlasting	death." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	89.	Is	the	Apostles'	Creed	an	act	of	faith?	A.	The	Apostles'	Creed	is	an	act	of faith,	because	by	it	we	profess	our	belief	in	the	truths	it	contains. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>helpless	as	a	dead	body,	and	can	merit	nothing	for	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	142.	What	does	our	"understanding"	mean?	A.	Our	"understanding"	means the	"gift	of	reason,"	by	which	man	is	distinguished	from	all	other	animals,	and by	which	he	is	enabled	to	think	and	thus	acquire	knowledge	and	regulate	his actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	143.	Can	we	learn	all	truths	by	our	reason	alone?	A.	We	can	not	learn	all truths	by	our	reason	alone,	for	some	truths	are	beyond	the	power	of	our	reason and	must	be	taught	to	us	by	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	144.	What	do	we	call	the	truths	God	teaches	us?	A.	Taken	together,	we	call the	truths	God	teaches	us	revelation,	and	we	call	the	manner	by	which	He teaches	them	also	revelation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	146.	Have	brute	animals	"understanding"	and	"free	will"?	A.	Brute	animals have	not	"understanding"	and	"free	will."	They	have	not	"understanding" </p>
<p class="calibre1">because	they	never	change	their	habits	or	better	their	condition.	They	have	not</p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	147.	What	gift	in	animals	supplies	the	place	of	reason?	A.	In	animals	the	gift of	"instinct"	supplies	the	place	of	reason	in	guiding	their	actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	148.	What	is	instinct?	A.	"Instinct"	is	a	gift	by	which	all	animals	are	impelled to	follow	the	laws	and	habits	that	God	has	given	to	their	nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	149.	Have	men	as	well	as	brutes	"instinct"?	A.	Men	have	"instinct,"	and	they show	it	when	placed	in	sudden	danger,	when	they	have	not	time	to	use	their reason.	A	falling	man	instantly	grasps	for	something	to	support	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	150.	{6}	Why	did	God	make	you?	A.	God	made	me	to	know	Him,	to	love Him,	and	to	serve	Him	in	this	world,	and	to	be	happy	with	Him	forever	in	the next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	151.	Why	is	it	necessary	to	know	God?	A.	It	is	necessary	to	know	God because	without	knowing	Him	we	cannot	love	Him;	and	without	loving	Him	we</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>cannot	be	saved.	We	should	know	Him	because	He	is	infinitely	true;	love	Him because	He	is	infinitely	beautiful;	and	serve	Him	because	He	is	infinitely	good. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	157.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"Church,	through	which	God	speaks	to	us"?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	"Church,	through	which	God	speaks	to	us,"	we	mean	the	"teaching Church";	that	is,	the	Pope,	Bishops,	and	priests,	whose	duty	it	is	to	instruct	us	in the	truths	and	practices	of	our	religion. </p>

I	believe	in	God,	the	Father	Almighty, Creator	of	heaven	and	earth;	and	in	Jesus	Christ,	His	only	Son,	our	Lord;	who was	conceived	by	the	Holy	Ghost,	born	of	the	Virgin	Mary,	suffered	under Pontius	Pilate,	was	crucified;	died,	and	was	buried.	He	descended	into	hell:	the third	day	He	arose	again	from	the	dead:	He	ascended	into	heaven,	sitteth	at	the right	hand	of	God,	the	Father	Almighty:	from	thence	He	shall	come	to	judge	the living	and	the	dead.

<p class="calibre1">Q.	168.	{16}	If	God	is	everywhere,	why	do	we	not	see	Him?	A.	We	do	not	see God,	because	He	is	a	pure	spirit	and	cannot	be	seen	with	bodily	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>Q.	169.	Why	do	we	call	God	a	"pure	spirit"?	A.	We	call	God	a	pure	spirit because	He	has	no	body.	Our	soul	is	a	spirit,	but	not	a	"pure"	spirit,	because	it was	created	for	union	with	our	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	170.	Why	can	we	not	see	God	with	the	eyes	of	our	body?	A.	We	cannot	see God	with	the	eyes	of	our	body	because	they	are	created	to	see	only	material things,	and	God	is	not	material	but	spiritual. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	177.	Why	must	God	be	"just"	as	well	as	"merciful"?	A.	God	must	be	just	as well	as	merciful	because	He	must	fulfill	His	promise	to	punish	those	who	merit punishment,	and	because	He	cannot	be	infinite	in	one	perfection	without	being infinite	in	all. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	183.	{22}	Why	can	there	be	but	one	God?	A.	There	can	be	but	one	God because	God,	being	supreme	and	infinite,	cannot	have	an	equal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	184.	What	does	"supreme"	mean?	A.	"Supreme"	means	the	highest	in authority;	also	the	most	excellent	or	greatest	possible	in	anything.	Thus	in	all things	God	is	supreme,	and	in	the	Church	the	Pope	is	supreme. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	201.	Why	must	a	divine	religion	have	mysteries?	A.	A	divine	religion	must have	mysteries	because	it	must	have	supernatural	truths	and	God	Himself	must teach	them.

<p class="calibre1">A.	Angels	appeared	to	the	Blessed	Virgin	and	St.	Joseph;	also	to Abraham,	Lot,	Jacob,	Tobias	and	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	219.	{36}	Were	the	angels	created	for	any	other	purpose?	A.	The	angels	were also	created	to	assist	before	the	throne	of	God	and	to	minister	unto	Him;	they have	often	been	sent	as	messengers	from	God	to	man;	and	are	also	appointed	our guardians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	220.	Are	all	the	Angels	equal	in	dignity?	A.	All	the	Angels	are	not	equal	in dignity.	There	are	nine	choirs	or	classes	mentioned	in	the	Holy	Scripture.	The highest	are	called	Seraphim	and	the	lowest	simply	Angels.	The	Archangels	are one	class	higher	than	ordinary	Angels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	221.	Mention	some	Archangels	and	tell	what	they	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Archangel	Michael	drove	Satan	out	of	heaven;	the	Archangel Gabriel	announced	to	the	Blessed	Virgin	that	she	was	to	become	the Mother	of	God.	The	Archangel	Raphael	guided	and	protected	Tobias. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	222.	Were	Angels	ever	sent	to	punish	men?	A.	Angels	were	sometimes	sent	to punish	men.	An	Angel	killed	185,000	men	in	the	army	of	a	wicked	king	who	had blasphemed	God;	an	Angel	also	slew	the	first-born	in	the	families	of	the Egyptians	who	had	persecuted	God's	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	223.	What	do	our	guardian	Angels	do	for	us?	A.	Our	guardian	Angels	pray for	us,	protect	and	guide	us,	and	offer	our	prayers,	good	works	and	desires	to God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	224.	How	do	we	know	that	Angels	offer	our	prayers	and	good	works	to God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	know	that	Angels	offer	our	prayers	and	good	works	to	God	because it	is	so	stated	in	Holy	Scripture,	and	Holy	Scripture	is	the	Word	of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	225.	Why	did	God	appoint	guardian	Angels	if	He	watches	over	us	Himself? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	God	appointed	guardian	Angels	to	secure	for	us	their	help	and	prayers,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>also	to	show	His	great	love	for	us	in	giving	us	these	special	servants	and	faithful friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	226.	{37}	Were	the	angels,	as	God	created	them,	good	and	happy? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	angels,	as	God	created	them,	were	good	and	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Q.	227.	{38}	Did	all	the	angels	remain	good	and	happy?	A.	All	the	angels	did not	remain	good	and	happy;	many	of	them	sinned	and	were	cast	into	hell,	and these	are	called	devils	or	bad	angels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	228.	Do	we	know	the	number	of	good	and	bad	Angels?	A.	We	do	not	know the	number	of	the	good	or	bad	Angels,	but	we	know	it	is	very	great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	229.	What	was	the	devil's	name	before	he	fell,	and	why	was	he	cast	out	of heaven?	A.	Before	he	fell,	Satan,	or	the	devil,	was	called	Lucifer,	or	light-bearer, a	name	which	indicates	great	beauty.	He	was	cast	out	of	heaven	because	through pride	he	rebelled	against	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	230.	How	do	the	bad	Angels	act	toward	us?	A.	The	bad	Angels	try	by	every means	to	lead	us	into	sin.	The	efforts	they	make	are	called	temptations	of	the devil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	231.	Why	does	the	devil	tempt	us?	A.	The	devil	tempts	us	because	he	hates goodness,	and	does	not	wish	us	to	enjoy	the	happiness	which	he	himself	has	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	232.	Can	we	by	our	own	power	overcome	the	temptations	of	the	devil?	A.	We cannot	by	our	own	power	overcome	the	temptations	of	the	devil,	because	the devil	is	wiser	than	we	are;	for,	being	an	Angel,	he	is	more	intelligent,	and	he	did not	lose	his	intelligence	by	falling	into	sin	any	more	than	we	do	now.	Therefore, to	overcome	his	temptations	we	need	the	help	of	God. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	233.	{39}	Who	were	the	first	man	and	woman? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	first	man	and	woman	were	Adam	and	Eve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	234.	Are	there	any	persons	in	the	world	who	are	not	the	descendants	of	Adam and	Eve?	A.	There	are	no	persons	in	the	world	now,	and	there	never	have	been any,	who	are	not	the	descendants	of	Adam	and	Eve,	because	the	whole	human race	had	but	one	origin. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&amp;c.,	which	we	find	in	distinct	races	do	not	indicate	a	difference	in	first	parents, for	these	differences	have	been	brought	about	in	the	lapse	of	time	by	other causes,	such	as	climate,	habits,	etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	236.	{40}	Were	Adam	and	Eve	innocent	and	holy	when	they	came	from	the hand	of	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Adam	and	Eve	were	innocent	and	holy	when	they	came	from	the	hand	of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	237.	What	do	we	mean	by	saying	Adam	and	Eve	"were	innocent"	when	they came	from	the	hand	of	God?	A.	When	we	say	Adam	and	Eve	"were	innocent" </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	they	came	from	the	hand	of	God	we	mean	they	were	in	the	state	of	original justice;	that	is,	they	were	gifted	with	every	virtue	and	free	from	every	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	238.	How	was	Adam's	body	formed?	A.	God	formed	Adam's	body	out	of	the clay	of	the	earth	and	then	breathed	into	it	a	living	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	239.	How	was	Eve's	body	formed?	A.	Eve's	body	was	formed	from	a	rib taken	from	Adam's	side	during	a	deep	sleep	which	God	caused	to	come	upon him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	240.	Why	did	God	make	Eve	from	one	of	Adam's	ribs?	A.	God	made	Eve from	one	of	Adam's	ribs	to	show	the	close	relationship	existing	between	husband and	wife	in	their	marriage	union	which	God	then	instituted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	241.	Could	man's	body	be	developed	from	the	body	of	an	inferior	animal?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Man's	body	could	be	developed	from	the	body	of	an	inferior	animal	if	God	so willed;	but	science	does	not	prove	that	man's	body	was	thus	formed,	while revelation	teaches	that	it	was	formed	directly	by	God	from	the	clay	of	the	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	242.	Could	man's	soul	and	intelligence	be	formed	by	the	development	of animal	life	and	instinct?	A.	Man's	soul	could	not	be	formed	by	the	development of	animal	instinct;	for,	being	entirely	spiritual,	it	must	be	created	by	God,	and	it is	united	to	the	body	as	soon	as	the	body	is	prepared	to	receive	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	243.	{41}	Did	God	give	any	command	to	Adam	and	Eve?	A.	To	try	their obedience,	God	commanded	Adam	and	Eve	not	to	eat	of	a	certain	fruit	which grew	in	the	garden	of	Paradise. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>Q.	244.	What	was	the	Garden	of	Paradise?	A.	The	Garden	of	Paradise	was	a large	and	beautiful	place	prepared	for	man's	habitation	upon	earth.	It	was supplied	with	every	species	of	plant	and	animal	and	with	everything	that	could contribute	to	man's	happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	245.	Where	was	the	Garden	of	Paradise	situated?	A.	The	exact	place	in	which the	Garden	of	Paradise—called	also	the	Garden	of	Eden—was	situated	is	not known,	for	the	deluge	may	have	so	changed	the	surface	of	the	earth	that	old landmarks	were	wiped	out.	It	was	probably	some	place	in	Asia,	not	far	from	the river	Euphrates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	246.	What	was	the	tree	bearing	the	forbidden	fruit	called?	A.	The	tree	bearing the	forbidden	fruit	was	called	"the	tree	of	knowledge	of	good	and	evil." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	247.	Do	we	know	the	name	of	any	other	tree	in	the	garden?	A.	We	know	the name	of	another	tree	in	the	Garden	called	the	"tree	of	life."	Its	fruit	kept	the bodies	of	our	first	parents	in	a	state	of	perfect	health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	248.	{42}	Which	were	the	chief	blessings	intended	for	Adam	and	Eve	had they	remained	faithful	to	God?	A.	The	chief	blessings	intended	for	Adam	and Eve,	had	they	remained	faithful	to	God,	were	a	constant	state	of	happiness	in	this life	and	everlasting	glory	in	the	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	249.	{43}	Did	Adam	and	Eve	remain	faithful	to	God?	A.	Adam	and	Eve	did not	remain	faithful	to	God,	but	broke	His	command	by	eating	the	forbidden	fruit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	250.	Who	was	the	first	to	disobey	God?	A.	Eve	was	the	first	to	disobey	God, and	she	induced	Adam	to	do	likewise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	251.	How	was	Eve	tempted	to	sin?	A.	Eve	was	tempted	to	sin	by	the	devil, who	came	in	the	form	of	a	serpent	and	persuaded	her	to	break	God's	command. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	252.	Which	were	the	chief	causes	that	led	Eve	into	sin?	A.	The	chief	causes that	led	Eve	into	sin	were:	(1)	She	went	into	the	danger	of	sinning	by	admiring what	was	forbidden,	instead	of	avoiding	it;	(2)	She	did	not	fly	from	the temptation	at	once,	but	debated	about	yielding	to	it.	Similar	conduct	on	our	part will	lead	us	also	into	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	253.	{44}	What	befell	Adam	and	Eve	on	account	of	their	sin?	A.	Adam	and Eve,	on	account	of	their	sin,	lost	innocence	and	holiness,	and	were	doomed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>sickness	and	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	254.	What	other	evils	befell	Adam	and	Eve	on	account	of	their	sin?	A.	Many other	evils	befell	Adam	and	Eve	on	account	of	their	sin.	They	were	driven	out	of Paradise	and	condemned	to	toil.	God	also	ordained	that	henceforth	the	earth should	yield	no	crops	without	cultivation,	and	that	the	beasts,	man's	former friends,	should	become	his	savage	enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	255.	Were	we	to	remain	in	the	Garden	of	Paradise	forever	if	Adam	had	not sinned?	A.	We	were	not	to	remain	in	the	Garden	of	Paradise	forever	even	if Adam	had	not	sinned,	but	after	passing	through	the	years	of	our	probation	or trial	upon	earth	we	were	to	be	taken,	body	and	soul,	into	heaven	without suffering	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	256.	{45}	What	evil	befell	us	on	account	of	the	disobedience	of	our	first parents?	A.	On	account	of	the	disobedience	of	our	first	parents,	we	all	share	in their	sin	and	punishment,	as	we	should	have	shared	in	their	happiness	if	they	had remained	faithful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	257.	Is	it	not	unjust	to	punish	us	for	the	sin	of	our	first	parents?	A.	It	is	not unjust	to	punish	us	for	the	sin	of	our	first	parents,	because	their	punishment consisted	in	being	deprived	of	a	free	gift	of	God;	that	is,	of	the	gift	of	original justice	to	which	they	had	no	strict	right	and	which	they	wilfully	forfeited	by	their act	of	disobedience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	258.	But	how	did	the	loss	of	the	gift	of	original	justice	leave	our	first	parents and	us	in	mortal	sin?	A.	The	loss	of	the	gift	of	original	justice	left	our	first parents	and	us	in	mortal	sin	because	it	deprived	them	of	the	Grace	of	God,	and	to be	without	this	gift	of	Grace	which	they	should	have	had	was	to	be	in	mortal	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	all	their	children	are	deprived	of	the	same	gift,	they,	too,	come	into	the	world in	a	state	of	mortal	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	259.	{46}	What	other	effects	followed	from	the	sin	of	our	first	parents?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	nature	was	corrupted	by	the	sin	of	our	first	parents,	which	darkened	our understanding,	weakened	our	will,	and	left	in	us	a	strong	inclination	to	evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	260.	What	do	we	mean	by	"our	nature	was	corrupted"?	A.	When	we	say	"our nature	was	corrupted"	we	mean	that	our	whole	being,	body	and	soul,	was	injured in	all	its	parts	and	powers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Q.	261.	Why	do	we	say	our	understanding	was	darkened?	A.	We	say	our understanding	was	darkened	because	even	with	much	learning	we	have	not	the clear	knowledge,	quick	perception	and	retentive	memory	that	Adam	had	before his	fall	from	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	262.	Why	do	we	say	our	will	was	weakened?	A.	We	say	our	will	was weakened	to	show	that	our	free	will	was	not	entirely	taken	away	by	Adam's	sin, and	that	we	have	it	still	in	our	power	to	use	our	free	will	in	doing	good	or	evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	263.	In	what	does	the	strong	inclination	to	evil	that	is	left	in	us	consist?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	strong	inclination	to	evil	that	is	left	in	us	consists	in	the	continual	efforts our	senses	and	appetites	make	to	lead	our	souls	into	sin.	The	body	is	inclined	to rebel	against	the	soul,	and	the	soul	itself	to	rebel	against	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	264.	What	is	this	strong	inclination	to	evil	called,	and	why	did	God	permit	it to	remain	in	us?	A.	This	strong	inclination	to	evil	is	called	concupiscence,	and God	permits	it	to	remain	in	us	that	by	His	grace	we	may	resist	it	and	thus increase	our	merits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	265.	{47}	What	is	the	sin	called	which	we	inherit	from	our	first parents? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	sin	which	we	inherit	from	our	first	parents	is	called	original sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	266.	{48}	Why	is	this	sin	called	original?	A.	This	sin	is	called	original because	it	comes	down	to	us	from	our	first	parents,	and	we	are	brought	into	the world	with	its	guilt	on	our	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	267.	{49}	Does	this	corruption	of	our	nature	remain	in	us	after original	sin	is	forgiven? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	This	corruption	of	our	nature	and	other	punishments	remain	in	us after	original	sin	is	forgiven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	268.	{50}	Was	any	one	ever	preserved	from	original	sin?	A.	The	Blessed Virgin	Mary,	through	the	merits	of	her	Divine	Son,	was	preserved	free	from	the guilt	of	original	sin,	and	this	privilege	is	called	her	Immaculate	Conception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	269.	Why	was	the	Blessed	Virgin	preserved	from	original	sin?	A.	The Blessed	Virgin	was	preserved	from	original	sin	because	it	would	not	be consistent	with	the	dignity	of	the	Son	of	God	to	have	His	Mother,	even	for	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>instant,	in	the	power	of	the	devil	and	an	enemy	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	270.	How	could	the	Blessed	Virgin	be	preserved	from	sin	by	her	Divine	Son, before	her	Son	was	born?	A.	The	Blessed	Virgin	could	be	preserved	from	sin	by her	Divine	Son	before	He	was	born	as	man,	for	He	always	existed	as	God	and foresaw	His	own	future	merits	and	the	dignity	of	His	Mother.	He	therefore	by His	future	merits	provided	for	her	privilege	of	exemption	from	original	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	271.	What	does	the	"Immaculate	Conception"	mean?	A.	The	Immaculate Conception	means	the	Blessed	Virgin's	own	exclusive	privilege	of	coming	into existence,	through	the	merits	of	Jesus	Christ,	without	the	stain	of	original	sin.	It does	not	mean,	therefore,	her	sinless	life,	perpetual	virginity	or	the	miraculous conception	of	Our	Divine	Lord	by	the	power	of	the	Holy	Ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	272.	What	has	always	been	the	belief	of	the	Church	concerning	this truth? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	has	always	believed	in	the	Immaculate	Conception	of	the Blessed	Virgin	and	to	place	this	truth	beyond	doubt	has	declared	it	an Article	of	Faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	273.	To	what	should	the	thoughts	of	the	Immaculate	Conception	lead	us?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thoughts	of	the	Immaculate	Conception	should	lead	us	to	a	great	love	of purity	and	to	a	desire	of	imitating	the	Blessed	Virgin	in	the	practice	of	that	holy virtue. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	SIXTH.	ON	SIN	AND	ITS	KINDS. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	274.	How	is	sin	divided?	A.	(1)	Sin	is	divided	into	the	sin	we	inherit	called original	sin,	and	the	sin	we	commit	ourselves,	called	actual	sin.	(2)	Actual	sin	is sub-divided	into	greater	sins,	called	mortal,	and	lesser	sins,	called	venial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	275.	In	how	many	ways	may	actual	sin	be	committed?	A.	Actual	sin	may	be committed	in	two	ways:	namely,	by	wilfully	doing	things	forbidden,	or	by wilfully	neglecting	things	commanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	276.	What	is	our	sin	called	when	we	neglect	things	commanded? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	When	we	neglect	things	commanded	our	sin	is	called	a	sin	of	omission. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>Such	sins	as	wilfully	neglecting	to	hear	Mass	on	Sundays,	or	neglecting to	go	to	Confession	at	least	once	a	year,	are	sins	of	omission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	277.	{51}	Is	original	sin	the	only	kind	of	sin?	A.	Original	sin	is	not	the	only kind	of	sin;	there	is	another	kind	of	sin,	which	we	commit	ourselves,	called actual	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	278.	{52}	What	is	actual	sin?	A.	Actual	sin	is	any	wilful	thought,	word,	deed, or	omission	contrary	to	the	law	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	279.	{53}	How	many	kinds	of	actual	sin	are	there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	There	are	two	kinds	of	actual	sin—mortal	and	venial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	280.	{54}	What	is	mortal	sin? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Mortal	sin	is	a	grievous	offense	against	the	law	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	281.	{55}	Why	is	this	sin	called	mortal?	A.	This	sin	is	called	mortal	because it	deprives	us	of	spiritual	life,	which	is	sanctifying	grace,	and	brings	everlasting death	and	damnation	on	the	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	282.	{56}	How	many	things	are	necessary	to	make	a	sin	mortal?	A.	To	make a	sin	mortal,	three	things	are	necessary:	a	grievous	matter,	sufficient	reflection, and	full	consent	of	the	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	283.	What	do	we	mean	by	"grievous	matter"	with	regard	to	sin?	A.	By</p>
<p class="calibre1">"grievous	matter"	with	regard	to	sin	we	mean	that	the	thought,	word	or	deed	by which	mortal	sin	is	committed	must	be	either	very	bad	in	itself	or	severely prohibited,	and	therefore	sufficient	to	make	a	mortal	sin	if	we	deliberately	yield to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	284.	What	does	"sufficient	reflection	and	full	consent	of	the	will"	mean?	A. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	320.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"gates	of	heaven"?	A.	By	the	"gates	of	heaven" </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	321.	{61}	Who	is	the	Redeemer? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Our	Blessed	Lord	and	Saviour	Jesus	Christ	is	the	Redeemer	of	mankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	322.	What	does	the	name	"Jesus"	signify	and	how	was	this	name	given	to	Our Lord?	A.	The	name	"Jesus"	signifies	Saviour	or	Redeemer,	and	this	name	was given	to	Our	Lord	by	an	Angel	who	appeared	to	Joseph	and	said:	"Mary	shall bring	forth	a	Son;	and	thou	shalt	call	His	name	Jesus." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	326.	Could	not	men	have	been	deceived	in	the	miracles	of	Christ?	A.

And	if	Christ	performed	no	real	miracles,	how,	then,	could	He have	converted	the	world	and	have	persuaded	sinful	men	to	give	up	what	they loved	and	do	the	difficult	things	that	the	Christian	religion	imposes? </p>

False	accounts	of	these	miracles	could	not	have	been written	after	the	death	of	Our	Lord;	for	then	neither	His	friends	nor	His	enemies would	have	believed	them	without	proof.	Moreover,	the	enemies	of	Christ	did not	deny	the	miracles,	but	tried	to	explain	them	by	attributing	them	to	the	power of	the	devil	or	other	causes.	Again,	the	Apostles	and	the	Evangelists	who	wrote the	accounts	suffered	death	to	testify	their	belief	in	the	words	and	works	of	Our Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	328.	Did	Jesus	Christ	die	to	redeem	all	men	of	every	age	and	race	without exception?	A.	Jesus	Christ	died	to	redeem	all	men	of	every	age	and	race	without exception;	and	every	person	born	into	the	world	should	share	in	His	merits, without	which	no	one	can	be	saved. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>us	by	His	grace	or	because	He	is	the	Father	who	has	created	us;	but	we	are	not, therefore,	His	real	Children;	whereas,	Jesus	Christ,	His	only	real	and	true	Son, was	neither	adopted	nor	created,	but	was	begotten	of	His	Father	from	all	eternity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	332.	{63}	Why	is	Jesus	Christ	true	God?	A.	Jesus	Christ	is	true	God	because He	is	the	true	and	only	Son	of	God	the	Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	333.	{64}	Why	is	Jesus	Christ	true	man? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	338.	From	what	do	we	learn	that	Jesus	Christ	is	but	one	person?	A.	We	learn that	Jesus	Christ	is	but	one	person	from	Holy	Scripture	and	from	the	constant teaching	of	the	Church,	which	has	condemned	all	those	who	teach	the	contrary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	339.	{67}	Was	Jesus	Christ	always	God? </p>

Bethlehem	was	the	City	of	David, the	royal	ancestor	of	Mary	and	Joseph,	hence	they	had	to	register	there.	All	this was	done	by	the	Will	of	God,	that	the	prophecies	concerning	the	birth	of	His Divine	Son	might	be	fulfilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	358.	Why	was	Christ	born	in	a	stable?	A.	Christ	was	born	in	a	stable	because Joseph	and	Mary	were	poor	and	strangers	in	Bethlehem,	and	without	money	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>could	find	no	other	shelter.	This	was	permitted	by	Our	Lord	that	we	might	learn a	lesson	from	His	great	humility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	359.	In	giving	the	ancestors	or	forefathers	of	Our	Lord,	why	do	the	Gospels give	the	ancestors	of	Joseph,	who	was	only	Christ's	foster-father,	and	not	the ancestors	of	Mary,	who	was	Christ's	real	parent?	A.	In	giving	the	ancestors	of Our	Lord,	the	Gospels	give	the	ancestors	of	Joseph:	(1)	Because	the	ancestors	of women	were	not	usually	recorded	by	the	Jews;	and	(2)	Because	Mary	and Joseph	were	members	of	the	same	tribe,	and	had,	therefore,	the	same	ancestors; so	that,	in	giving	the	ancestors	of	Joseph,	the	Gospels	give	also	those	of	Mary; and	this	was	understood	by	those	for	whom	the	Gospels	were	intended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	360.	Had	Our	Lord	any	brothers	or	sisters?	A.	Our	Lord	had	no	brothers	or sisters.	When	the	Gospels	speak	of	His	brethren	they	mean	only	His	near relations.	His	Blessed	Mother	Mary	was	always	a	Virgin	as	well	before	and	at His	birth	as	after	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	361.	Who	were	among	the	first	to	adore	the	Infant	Jesus?	A.	The	shepherds	of Bethlehem,	to	whom	His	birth	was	announced	by	Angels;	and	the	Magi	or	three wise	men,	who	were	guided	to	His	crib	by	a	miraculous	star,	were	among	the first	to	adore	the	Infant	Jesus.	We	recall	the	adoration	of	the	Magi	on	the	feast	of the	Epiphany,	which	means	appearance	or	manifestation,	namely,	of	Our Saviour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	362.	Who	sought	to	kill	the	Infant	Jesus?	A.	Herod	sought	to	kill	the	Infant Jesus	because	he	thought	the	influence	of	Christ—the	new-born	King—would deprive	him	of	his	throne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	363.	How	was	the	Holy	Infant	rescued	from	the	power	of	Herod?	A.	The Holy	Infant	was	rescued	from	the	power	of	Herod	by	the	flight	into	Egypt,	when St.	Joseph—warned	by	an	Angel—fled	hastily	into	that	country	with	Jesus	and Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	364.	How	did	Herod	hope	to	accomplish	his	wicked	designs?	A.	Herod	hoped to	accomplish	his	wicked	designs	by	murdering	all	the	infants	in	and	near Bethlehem.	The	day	on	which	we	commemorate	the	death	of	these	first	little martyrs,	who	shed	their	blood	for	Christ's	sake,	is	called	the	feast	of	Holy Innocents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	365.	How	may	the	years	of	Christ's	life	be	divided?	A.	The	years	of	Christ's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>life	may	be	divided	into	three	parts:	(1)	His	childhood,	extending	from	His	birth to	His	twelfth	year,	when	He	went	with	his	parents	to	worship	in	the	Temple	of Jerusalem.	(2)	His	hidden	life,	which	extends	from	His	twelfth	to	His	thirtieth year,	during	which	time	He	dwelt	with	His	parents	at	Nazareth.	(3)	His	public life,	extending	from	His	thirtieth	year—or	from	His	baptism	by	St.	John	the Baptist	to	His	death;	during	which	time	He	taught	His	doctrines	and	established His	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	366.	Why	is	Christ's	life	thus	divided?	A.	Christ's	life	is	thus	divided	to	show that	all	classes	find	in	Him	their	model.	In	childhood	He	gave	an	example	to	the young;	in	His	hidden	life	an	example	to	those	who	consecrate	themselves	to	the service	of	God	in	a	religious	state;	and	in	His	public	life	an	example	to	all Christians	without	exception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	367.	{76}	How	long	did	Christ	live	on	earth?	A.	Christ	lived	on	earth	about thirty-three	years,	and	led	a	most	holy	life	in	poverty	and	suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	368.	{77}	Why	did	Christ	live	so	long	on	earth?	A.	Christ	lived	so	long	on earth	to	show	us	the	way	to	heaven	by	His	teachings	and	example. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	369.	What	do	we	mean	by	Our	Lord's	Passion?	A.	By	Our	Lord's	Passion	we mean	His	dreadful	sufferings	from	His	agony	in	the	garden	till	the	moment	of His	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	370.	{78}	What	did	Jesus	Christ	suffer?	A.	Jesus	Christ	suffered	a	bloody sweat,	a	cruel	scourging,	was	crowned	with	thorns,	and	was	crucified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	371.	When	did	Our	Lord	suffer	the	"bloody	sweat"?	A.	Our	Lord	suffered	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"bloody	sweat"	while	drops	of	blood	came	forth	from	every	pore	of	His	body, during	His	agony	in	the	Garden	of	Olives,	near	Jerusalem,	where	He	went	to pray	on	the	night	His	Passion	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	372.	Who	accompanied	Our	Lord	to	the	Garden	of	Olives	on	the	night	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>His	Agony? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Apostles	Peter,	James	and	John,	the	same	who	had	witnessed	His transfiguration	on	the	mount,	accompanied	Our	Lord	to	the	Garden	of Olives,	to	watch	and	pray	with	Him	on	the	night	of	His	agony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	373.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	transfiguration	of	Our	Lord?	A.	By	the transfiguration	of	Our	Lord	we	mean	the	supernatural	change	in	His	appearance when	He	showed	Himself	to	His	Apostles	in	great	glory	and	brilliancy	in	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">"His	face	did	shine	as	the	sun	and	His	garments	became	white	as	snow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	374.	Who	were	present	at	the	transfiguration? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	There	were	present	at	the	transfiguration—besides	the	Apostles Peter,	James	and	John,	who	witnessed	it—the	two	great	and	holy	men	of the	Old	Law,	Moses	and	Elias,	talking	with	Our	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	375.	What	caused	Our	Lord's	agony	in	the	garden?	A.	It	is	believed	Our Lord's	agony	in	the	garden	was	caused:	(1)	By	his	clear	knowledge	of	all	He	was soon	to	endure;	(2)	by	the	sight	of	the	many	offenses	committed	against	His Father	by	the	sins	of	the	whole	world;	(3)	by	His	knowledge	of	men's	ingratitude for	the	blessings	of	redemption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	376.	Why	was	Christ	cruelly	scourged?	A.	Christ	was	cruelly	scourged	by Pilate's	orders,	that	the	sight	of	His	bleeding	body	might	move	His	enemies	to spare	His	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	377.	Why	was	Christ	crowned	with	thorns?	A.	Christ	was	crowned	with thorns	in	mockery	because	He	had	said	He	was	a	King. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	378.	Could	Christ,	if	He	pleased,	have	escaped	the	tortures	of	His Passion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Christ	could,	if	He	pleased,	have	escaped	the	tortures	of	His Passion,	because	He	foresaw	them	and	had	it	in	His	power	to	overcome	His enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	379.	Was	it	necessary	for	Christ	to	suffer	so	much	in	order	to	redeem	us?	A.	It was	not	necessary	for	Christ	to	suffer	so	much	in	order	to	redeem	us,	for	the	least of	His	sufferings	was	more	than	sufficient	to	atone	for	all	the	sins	of	mankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	suffering	so	much	He	showed	His	great	love	for	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	380.	Who	betrayed	Our	Lord?	A.	Judas,	one	of	His	Apostles,	betrayed	Our</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>Lord,	and	from	His	sin	we	may	learn	that	even	the	good	may	become	very wicked	by	the	abuse	of	their	free	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	381.	How	was	Christ	condemned	to	death?	A.	Through	the	influence	of	those who	hated	Him,	Christ	was	condemned	to	death,	after	an	unjust	trial,	at	which false	witnesses	were	induced	to	testify	against	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	382.	{79}	On	what	day	did	Christ	die? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Christ	died	on	Good	Friday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	383.	{80}	Why	do	you	call	that	day	"good"	on	which	Christ	died	so sorrowful	a	death? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	call	that	day	good	on	which	Christ	died	because	by	His	death	He showed	His	great	love	for	man,	and	purchased	for	him	every	blessing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	384.	How	long	was	Our	Lord	hanging	on	the	cross	before	He	died? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Our	Lord	was	hanging	on	the	Cross	about	three	hours	before	He	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	thus	suffering,	His	enemies	stood	around	blaspheming	and	mocking Him.	By	His	death	He	proved	Himself	a	real	mortal	man,	for	He	could	not die	in	His	divine	nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	385.	What	do	we	call	the	words	Christ	spoke	while	hanging	on	the	Cross?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	call	the	words	Christ	spoke	while	hanging	on	the	Cross	"the	seven	last	words of	Jesus	on	the	Cross."	They	teach	us	the	dispositions	we	should	have	at	the	hour of	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	386.	Repeat	the	seven	last	words	or	sayings	of	Jesus	on	the	Cross.	A.	The seven	last	words	or	sayings	of	Jesus	on	the	Cross	are:	(1)	"Father,	forgive	them, for	they	know	not	what	they	do,"	in	which	He	forgives	and	prays	for	His enemies.	(2)	"Amen,	I	say	to	thee,	this	day	thou	shalt	be	with	Me	in	Paradise,"	in which	He	pardons	the	penitent	sinner.	(3)	"Woman,	behold	thy	Son"—"Behold thy	Mother,"	in	which	He	gave	up	what	was	dearest	to	Him	on	earth,	and	gave	us Mary	for	our	Mother.	(4)	"My	God,	my	God,	why	hast	Thou	forsaken	Me?"	from which	we	learn	the	suffering	of	His	mind.	(5)	"I	thirst,"	from	which	we	learn	the suffering	of	His	body.	(6)	"All	is	consummated,"	by	which	He	showed	the fulfillment	of	all	the	prophecies	concerning	Him	and	the	completion	of	the	work of	our	redemption.	(7)	"Father,	into	Thy	hands	I	commend	my	spirit,"	by	which He	showed	His	perfect	resignation	to	the	Will	of	His	Eternal	Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	387.	What	happened	at	the	death	of	Our	Lord?	A.	At	the	death	of	Our	Lord</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>there	were	darkness	and	earthquake;	many	holy	dead	came	forth	from	their graves,	and	the	veil	concealing	the	Holy	of	Holies,	in	the	Temple	of	Jerusalem, was	torn	asunder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	388.	What	was	the	Holy	of	Holies	in	the	temple? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Holy	of	Holies	was	the	sacred	part	of	the	Temple,	in	which	the Ark	of	the	Covenant	was	kept,	and	where	the	high	priest	consulted	the Will	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	389.	What	was	the	"Ark	of	the	Covenant"?	A.	The	Ark	of	the	Covenant	was	a precious	box	in	which	were	kept	the	tablets	of	stone	bearing	the	written Commandments	of	God,	the	rod	which	Aaron	changed	into	a	serpent	before King	Pharao,	and	a	portion	of	the	manna	with	which	the	Israelites	were miraculously	fed	in	the	desert.	The	Ark	of	the	Covenant	was	a	figure	of	the Tabernacle	in	which	we	keep	the	Holy	Eucharist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	390.	Why	was	the	veil	of	the	Temple	torn	asunder	at	the	death	of	Christ?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	veil	of	the	Temple	was	torn	asunder	at	the	death	of	Christ	because	at	His death	the	Jewish	religion	ceased	to	be	the	true	religion,	and	God	no	longer manifested	His	presence	in	the	Temple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	391.	Why	did	the	Jewish	religion,	which	up	to	the	death	of	Christ	had	been the	true	religion,	cease	at	that	time	to	be	the	true	religion?	A.	The	Jewish religion,	which,	up	to	the	death	of	Christ,	had	been	the	true	religion,	ceased	at that	time	to	be	the	true	religion,	because	it	was	only	a	promise	of	the	redemption and	figure	of	the	Christian	religion,	and	when	the	redemption	was	accomplished and	the	Christian	religion	established	by	the	death	of	Christ,	the	promise	and	the figure	were	no	longer	necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	392.	Were	all	the	laws	of	the	Jewish	religion	abolished	by	the	establishment of	Christianity?	A.	The	moral	laws	of	the	Jewish	religion	were	not	abolished	by the	establishment	of	Christianity,	for	Christ	came	not	to	destroy	these	laws,	but to	make	them	more	perfect.	Its	ceremonial	laws	were	abolished	when	the	Temple of	Jerusalem	ceased	to	be	the	House	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	393.	What	do	we	mean	by	moral	and	ceremonial	laws? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	By	"moral"	laws	we	mean	laws	regarding	good	and	evil.	By	"ceremonial" </p>
<p class="calibre1">laws	we	mean	laws	regulating	the	manner	of	worshipping	God	in	Temple	or Church. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	396.	{82}	How	did	Christ	die? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Christ	was	nailed	to	the	Cross,	and	died	on	it	between	two	thieves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	397.	Why	was	Our	Lord	crucified	between	thieves?	A.	Our	Lord	was crucified	between	thieves	that	His	enemies	might	thus	add	to	His	disgrace	by making	Him	equal	to	the	worst	criminals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	398.	{83}	Why	did	Christ	suffer	and	die? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	400.	{84}	What	lessons	do	we	learn	from	the	sufferings	and	death	of Christ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	From	the	sufferings	and	death	of	Christ	we	learn	the	great	evil	of sin,	the	hatred	God	bears	to	it,	and	the	necessity	of	satisfying	for	it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	402.	{86}	Did	Christ's	soul	descend	into	the	hell	of	the	damned?	A.	The	hell into	which	Christ's	soul	descended	was	not	the	hell	of	the	dammed,	but	a	place or	state	of	rest	called	Limbo,	where	the	souls	of	the	just	were	waiting	for	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	403.	{87}	Why	did	Christ	descend	into	Limbo?	A.	Christ	descended	into Limbo	to	preach	to	the	souls	who	were	in	prison—that	is,	to	announce	to	them the	joyful	tidings	of	their	redemption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	404.	{88}	Where	was	Christ's	body	while	His	soul	was	in	Limbo? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	406.	Why	is	the	Resurrection	the	greatest	of	Christ's	miracles?	A.	The Resurrection	is	the	greatest	of	Christ's	miracles	because	all	He	taught	and	did	is confirmed	by	it	and	depends	upon	it.	He	promised	to	rise	from	the	dead	and without	the	fulfillment	of	that	promise	we	could	not	believe	in	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	407.	Has	any	one	ever	tried	to	disprove	the	miracle	of	the	resurrection?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbelievers	in	Christ	have	tried	to	disprove	the	miracle	of	the	resurrection	as they	have	tried	to	disprove	all	His	other	miracles;	but	the	explanations	they	give to	prove	Christ's	miracles	false	are	far	more	unlikely	and	harder	to	believe	than the	miracles	themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	408.	What	do	we	mean	when	we	say	Christ	rose	"glorious"	from	the	dead?	A. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	409.	What	are	the	qualities	of	a	glorified	body?	A.	The	qualities	of	a	glorified body	are:	(1)	Brilliancy,	by	which	it	gives	forth	light;	(2)	Agility,	by	which	it moves	from	place	to	place	as	rapidly	as	an	angel;	(3)	Subtility,	by	which	material things	cannot	shut	it	out;	(4)	Impassibility,	by	which	it	is	made	incapable	of suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	410.	Was	Christ	three	full	days	in	the	tomb?	A.	Christ	was	not	three	full	days, but	only	parts	of	three	days	in	the	tomb. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	413.	How	did	Christ	show	that	He	was	truly	risen	from	the	dead?	A.	Christ showed	that	He	was	truly	risen	from	the	dead	by	eating	and	conversing	with	His</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>Apostles	and	others	to	whom	He	appeared.	He	showed	the	wounds	in	His	hands, feet	and	side,	and	it	was	after	His	resurrection	that	He	gave	to	His	Apostles	the power	to	forgive	sins. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From	various	parts	of	Scripture	we	may	conclude	there	were	about	125	persons</p>
<p class="calibre1">—though	traditions	tell	us	there	was	a	greater	number—present	at	the Ascension.	They	were	the	Apostles,	the	Disciples,	the	pious	women	and	others who	had	followed	Our	Blessed	Lord.	The	souls	of	the	just	who	were	waiting	in Limbo	for	the	redemption	ascended	with	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	417.	Why	is	the	paschal	candle	which	is	lighted	on	Easter	morning extinguished	at	the	Mass	on	Ascension	Day?	A.	The	paschal	candle	which	is lighted	on	Easter	morning	signifies	Christ's	visible	presence	on	earth,	and	it	is extinguished	on	Ascension	Day	to	show	that	He,	having	fulfilled	all	the prophecies	concerning	Himself	and	having	accomplished	the	work	of redemption,	has	transferred	the	visible	care	of	His	Church	to	His	Apostles	and returned	in	His	body	to	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	418.	{92}	Where	is	Christ	in	heaven? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	In	heaven	Christ	sits	at	the	right	hand	of	God	the	Father	Almighty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	419.	{93}	What	do	you	mean	by	saying	that	Christ	sits	at	the	right hand	of	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	When	I	say	that	Christ	sits	at	the	right	hand	of	God	I	mean	that Christ	as	God	is	equal	to	His	Father	in	all	things,	and	that	as	man	He is	in	the	highest	place	in	heaven	next	to	God. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	420.	{94}	Who	is	the	Holy	Ghost? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Holy	Ghost	is	the	third	Person	of	the	Blessed	Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	421.	Did	the	Holy	Ghost	ever	appear?	A.	The	Holy	Ghost	appeared	at	times under	the	form	of	a	dove,	and	again	under	the	form	of	tongues	of	fire;	for,	being a	pure	spirit	without	a	body,	He	can	take	any	form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	422.	Is	the	Holy	Ghost	called	by	other	names? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Holy	Ghost	is	called	also	the	Holy	Spirit,	the	Paraclete,	the Spirit	of	Truth	and	other	names	given	in	Holy	Scripture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	423.	{95}	From	whom	does	the	Holy	Ghost	proceed? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	425.	{97}	On	what	day	did	the	Holy	Ghost	come	down	upon	the	Apostles? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Holy	Ghost	came	down	upon	the	Apostles	ten	days	after	the Ascension	of	our	Lord;	and	the	day	on	which	He	came	down	upon	the Apostles	is	called	Whitsunday,	or	Pentecost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	426.	Why	is	the	day	on	which	the	Holy	Ghost	came	down	upon	the	Apostles called	Whitsunday?	A.	The	day	on	which	the	Holy	Ghost	came	down	upon	the Apostles	is	called	Whitsunday	or	White	Sunday,	probably	because	the	Christians who	were	baptized	on	the	eve	of	Pentecost	wore	white	garments	for	some	time afterward,	as	a	mark	of	the	purity	bestowed	upon	their	souls	by	the	Sacrament	of Baptism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	427.	Why	is	this	feast	called	also	Pentecost?	A.	This	feast	is	called	also Pentecost	because	Pentecost	means	the	fiftieth;	and	the	Holy	Ghost	came	down upon	the	Apostles	fifty	days	after	the	resurrection	of	Our	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	428.	{98}	How	did	the	Holy	Ghost	come	down	upon	the	Apostles?	A.	The Holy	Ghost	came	down	upon	the	Apostles	in	the	form	of	tongues	of	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>Q.	429.	What	did	the	form	of	tongues	of	fire	denote?	A.	The	form	of	tongues	of fire	denoted	the	sacred	character	and	divine	authority	of	the	preaching	and teaching	of	the	Apostles,	by	whose	words	and	fervor	all	men	were	to	be converted	to	the	love	of	God. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	431.	Did	the	Apostles	know	that	the	Holy	Ghost	would	come	down	upon them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Apostles	knew	that	the	Holy	Ghost	would	come	down	upon	them;	for Christ	promised	His	Apostles	that	after	His	Ascension	He	would	send	the Holy	Ghost,	the	Spirit	of	Truth,	to	teach	them	all	truths	and	to	abide with	them	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	432.	Has	any	one	ever	denied	the	existence	of	the	Holy	Ghost?	A.	Some persons	have	denied	the	existence	of	the	Holy	Ghost;	others	have	denied	that	He is	a	real	person	equal	to	the	Father	and	the	Son;	but	all	these	assertions	are shown	to	be	false	by	the	words	of	Holy	Scripture	and	the	infallible	teaching	of the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	433.	What	are	the	sins	against	the	Holy	Ghost	which	Our	Lord	said	will	not be	forgiven	either	in	this	world	or	in	the	next?	A.	The	sins	against	the	Holy Ghost	which	Our	Lord	said	will	not	be	forgiven	either	in	this	world	or	in	the next,	are	sins	committed	out	of	pure	malice,	and	greatly	opposed	to	the	mercy	of God,	and	are,	therefore,	seldom	forgiven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	434.	{100}	Why	did	Christ	send	the	Holy	Ghost?	A.	Christ	sent	the	Holy Ghost	to	sanctify	His	Church,	to	enlighten	and	strengthen	the	Apostles,	and	to enable	them	to	preach	the	Gospel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	435.	How	was	the	Church	sanctified	through	the	coming	of	the	Holy	Ghost? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	was	sanctified	through	the	coming	of	the	Holy	Ghost	by receiving	those	graces	which	Christ	had	merited	for	His	ministers,	the	bishops and	priests,	and	for	the	souls	of	all	those	committed	to	their	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	436.	How	were	the	Apostles	enlightened	through	the	coming	of	the	Holy Ghost?	A.	The	Apostles	were	enlightened	through	the	coming	of	the	Holy	Ghost by	receiving	the	grace	to	remember	and	understand	in	its	true	meaning	all	that Christ	had	said	and	done	in	their	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>Q.	437.	How	were	the	Apostles	strengthened	through	the	coming	of	the	Holy Ghost?	A.	The	Apostles	were	strengthened	through	the	coming	of	the	Holy Ghost	by	receiving	the	grace	to	brave	every	danger,	even	death	itself,	in	the performance	of	their	sacred	duties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	438.	What	does	"Apostle,"	and	what	does	"Gospel"	mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	"Apostle"	means	a	person	sent,	and	"Gospel"	means	good	tidings	or news.	Hence	the	name	"Gospel"	is	given	to	the	inspired	history	of	Our Lord's	life	and	works	upon	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	439.	Name	the	Apostles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Apostles	were:	Peter,	Andrew,	James,	John,	Philip,	Bartholomew, Thomas,	Matthew,	James,	Thaddeus,	Simon,	and	Judas	Iscariot,	in	whose place	Mathias	was	chosen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	440.	Was	St.	Paul	an	Apostle? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	St.	Paul	was	an	Apostle,	but	as	he	was	not	called	till	after	the Ascension	of	Our	Lord	he	is	not	numbered	among	the	twelve.	He	is	called the	Apostle	of	the	Gentiles;	that	is,	of	all	those	who	were	not	of	the Jewish	religion	or	members	of	the	Church	of	the	Old	Law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	441.	How	did	St.	Paul	become	an	Apostle?	A.	While	on	his	way	to	persecute the	Christians	St.	Paul	was	miraculously	converted	and	called	to	be	an	Apostle by	Our	Lord	Himself,	who	spoke	to	him.	St.	Paul	was	called	Saul	before	his conversion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	442.	Who	were	the	Evangelists?	A.	St.	Matthew,	St.	Mark,	St.	Luke	and	St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John	are	called	Evangelists,	because	they	wrote	the	four	Gospels	bearing	their names,	and	Evangelia	is	the	Latin	name	for	Gospels.	St.	Mark	and	St.	Luke	were not	Apostles,	but	St.	Matthew	and	St.	John	were	both	Apostles	and	Evangelists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	443.	Why	did	not	the	Apostles	fully	understand	when	Christ	Himself	taught them?	A.	The	Apostles	did	not	fully	understand	when	Christ	Himself	taught them	because	during	His	stay	with	them	on	earth	they	were	only	preparing	to become	Apostles;	and	their	minds	were	yet	filled	with	many	worldly	thoughts and	desires	that	were	to	be	removed	at	the	coming	of	the	Holy	Ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	444.	{101}	Will	the	Holy	Ghost	abide	with	the	Church	forever?	A.	The	Holy Ghost	will	abide	with	the	Church	forever,	and	guide	it	in	the	way	of	holiness	and truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>Q.	445.	What	benefit	do	we	derive	from	the	knowledge	that	the	Holy	Ghost	will abide	with	the	Church	forever?	A.	From	the	knowledge	that	the	Holy	Ghost	will abide	with	the	Church	forever	we	are	made	certain	that	the	Church	can	never teach	us	falsehood,	and	can	never	be	destroyed	by	the	enemies	of	Our	Faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	446.	What	visible	power	was	given	to	the	Apostles	through	the	coming	of	the Holy	Ghost?	A.	Through	the	coming	of	the	Holy	Ghost	the	Apostles	received	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"gift	of	tongues,"	by	which	they	could	be	understood	in	every	language,	though they	preached	in	only	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	447.	Why	did	such	wonderful	gifts	accompany	Confirmation,	or	the	coming of	the	Holy	Ghost,	in	the	first	ages	of	the	Church?	A.	Such	wonderful	gifts accompanied	Confirmation	in	the	first	ages	of	the	Church	to	prove	the	power, truth	and	divine	character	of	Christianity	to	those	who	otherwise	might	not believe,	and	to	draw	the	attention	of	all	to	the	establishment	of	the	Christian Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	448.	Why	are	these	signs	not	continued	everywhere	at	the	present	time?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	signs	are	not	continued	everywhere	at	the	present	time,	because	now	that the	Church	is	fully	established	and	its	divine	character	and	power	proved	in other	ways,	such	signs	are	no	longer	necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	449.	Were	such	powers	as	the	"gift	of	tongues"	a	part	of	the	Sacrament	of Confirmation?	A.	Such	powers	as	the	"gift	of	tongues"	were	not	a	part	of	the Sacrament	of	Confirmation,	but	they	were	added	to	it	by	the	Holy	Ghost	when necessary	for	the	good	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	TENTH.	ON	THE	EFFECTS	OF	THE	REDEMPTION. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	450.	What	is	an	effect?	A.	An	effect	is	that	which	is	caused	by	something else,	as	smoke,	for	example,	is	an	effect	of	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	451.	What	does	redemption	mean?	A.	Redemption	means	the	buying	back	of a	thing	that	was	given	away	or	sold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	452.	What	did	Adam	give	away	by	his	sin,	and	what	did	Our	Lord	buy	back for	him	and	us?	A.	By	his	sin	Adam	gave	away	all	right	to	God's	promised	gifts</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>of	grace	in	this	world	and	of	glory	in	the	next,	and	Our	Lord	bought	back	the right	that	Adam	threw	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	453.	{102}	Which	are	the	chief	effects	of	the	Redemption? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	chief	effects	of	the	Redemption	are	two:	The	satisfaction	of God's	justice	by	Christ's	sufferings	and	death,	and	the	gaining	of	grace for	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	454.	Why	do	we	say	"chief	effects"?	A.	We	say	"chief	effects"	to	show	that these	are	the	most	important	but	not	the	only	effects	of	the	Redemption—for	all the	benefits	of	our	holy	religion	and	of	its	influence	upon	the	world	are	the effects	of	the	redemption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	455.	Why	did	God's	justice	require	satisfaction?	A.	God's	justice	required satisfaction	because	it	is	infinite	and	demands	reparation	for	every	fault.	Man	in his	state	of	sin	could	not	make	the	necessary	reparation,	so	Christ	became	man and	made	it	for	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	456.	{103}	What	do	you	mean	by	grace?	A.	By	grace	I	mean	a	supernatural gift	of	God	bestowed	on	us,	through	the	merits	of	Jesus	Christ,	for	our	salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	457.	What	does	"supernatural"	mean?	A.	Supernatural	means	above	or	greater than	nature.	All	gifts	such	as	health,	learning	or	the	comforts	of	life,	that	affect our	happiness	chiefly	in	this	world,	are	called	natural	gifts,	and	all	gifts	such	as blessings	that	affect	our	happiness	chiefly	in	the	next	world	are	called supernatural	or	spiritual	gifts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	458.	What	do	you	mean	by	"merit"?	A.	Merit	means	the	quality	of	deserving well	or	ill	for	our	actions.	In	the	question	above	it	means	a	right	to	reward	for good	deeds	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	459.	{104}	How	many	kinds	of	grace	are	there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	There	are	two	kinds	of	grace,	sanctifying	grace	and	actual	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	460.	What	is	the	difference	between	sanctifying	grace	and	actual	grace?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sanctifying	grace	remains	with	us	as	long	as	we	are	not	guilty	of	mortal	sin;	and hence,	it	is	often	called	habitual	grace;	but	actual	grace	comes	to	us	only	when we	need	its	help	in	doing	or	avoiding	an	action,	and	it	remains	with	us	only while	we	are	doing	or	avoiding	the	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>Q.	461.	{105}	What	is	sanctifying	grace?	A.	Sanctifying	grace	is	that	grace which	makes	the	soul	holy	and	pleasing	to	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	462.	{106}	What	do	you	call	those	graces	or	gifts	of	God	by	which	we believe	in	Him,	hope	in	Him,	and	love	Him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Those	graces	or	gifts	of	God	by	which	we	believe	in	Him,	and	hope	in Him,	and	love	Him,	are	called	the	Divine	virtues	of	Faith,	Hope,	and Charity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	463.	What	do	you	mean	by	virtue	and	vice?	A.	Virtue	is	the	habit	of	doing good,	and	vice	is	the	habit	of	doing	evil.	An	act,	good	or	bad,	does	not	form	a habit;	and	hence,	a	virtue	or	a	vice	is	the	result	of	repeated	acts	of	the	same	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	464.	Does	habit	excuse	us	from	the	sins	committed	through	it?	A.	Habit	does not	excuse	us	from	the	sins	committed	through	it,	but	rather	makes	us	more guilty	by	showing	how	often	we	must	have	committed	the	sin	to	acquire	the habit.	If,	however,	we	are	seriously	trying	to	overcome	a	bad	habit,	and	through forgetfulness	yield	to	it,	the	habit	may	sometimes	excuse	us	from	the	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	465.	{107}	What	is	Faith? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Faith	is	a	Divine	virtue	by	which	we	firmly	believe	the	truths	which God	has	revealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	466.	{108}	What	is	Hope?	A.	Hope	is	a	Divine	virtue	by	which	we	firmly trust	that	God	will	give	us	eternal	life	and	the	means	to	obtain	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	467.	{109}	What	is	Charity? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Charity	is	a	Divine	virtue	by	which	we	love	God	above	all	things	for His	own	sake,	and	our	neighbor	as	ourselves	for	the	love	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	468.	Why	are	Faith,	Hope	and	Charity	called	virtues?	A.	Faith,	Hope	and Charity	are	called	virtues	because	they	are	not	mere	acts,	but	habits	by	which	we always	and	in	all	things	believe	God,	hope	in	Him,	and	love	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	469.	What	kind	of	virtues	are	Faith,	Hope	and	Charity? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Faith,	Hope	and	Charity	are	called	infused	theological	virtues	to distinguish	them	from	the	four	moral	virtues—Prudence,	Justice, Fortitude	and	Temperance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	470.	Why	do	we	say	the	three	theological	virtues	are	infused	and	the	four</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>moral	virtues	acquired?	A.	We	say	the	three	theological	virtues	are	infused;	that is,	poured	into	our	souls,	because	they	are	strictly	gifts	of	God	and	do	not	depend upon	our	efforts	to	obtain	them,	while	the	four	moral	virtues—Prudence,	Justice, Fortitude	and	Temperance—though	also	gifts	of	God,	may,	as	natural	virtues,	be acquired	by	our	own	efforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	471.	Why	do	we	believe	God,	hope	in	Him,	and	love	Him?	A.	We	believe God	and	hope	in	Him	because	He	is	infinitely	true	and	cannot	deceive	us.	We love	Him	because	He	is	infinitely	good	and	beautiful	and	worthy	of	all	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	472.	What	mortal	sins	are	opposed	to	Faith?	A.	Atheism,	which	is	a	denial	of all	revealed	truths,	and	heresy,	which	is	a	denial	of	some	revealed	truths,	and superstition,	which	is	a	misuse	of	religion,	are	opposed	to	Faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	473.	Who	is	our	neighbor?	A.	Every	human	being	capable	of	salvation	of every	age,	country,	race	or	condition,	especially	if	he	needs	our	help,	is	our neighbor	in	the	sense	of	the	Catechism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	474.	Why	should	we	love	our	neighbor? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	should	love	our	neighbor	because	he	is	a	child	of	God,	redeemed	by Jesus	Christ,	and	because	he	is	our	brother	created	to	dwell	in	heaven with	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	475.	{110}	What	is	actual	grace?	A.	Actual	grace	is	that	help	of	God	which enlightens	our	mind	and	moves	our	will	to	shun	evil	and	do	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	476.	{111}	Is	grace	necessary	to	salvation?	A.	Grace	is	necessary	to salvation,	because	without	grace	we	can	do	nothing	to	merit	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	477.	{112}	Can	we	resist	the	grace	of	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	can,	and	unfortunately	often	do,	resist	the	grace	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	478.	Is	it	a	sin	knowingly	to	resist	the	grace	of	God?	A.	It	is	a	sin,	knowingly, to	resist	the	grace	of	God,	because	we	thereby	insult	Him	and	reject	His	gifts without	which	we	cannot	be	saved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	479.	Does	God	give	His	grace	to	every	one?	A.	God	gives	to	everyone	He creates	sufficient	grace	to	save	his	soul;	and	if	persons	do	not	save	their	souls,	it is	because	they	have	not	used	the	grace	given. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>Q.	480.	{113}	What	is	the	grace	of	perseverance?	A.	The	grace	of	perseverance is	a	particular	gift	of	God	which	enables	us	to	continue	in	the	state	of	grace	till death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	481.	Can	we	merit	the	grace	of	final	perseverance	or	know	when	we	possess it?	A.	We	cannot	merit	the	grace	of	final	perseverance,	or	know	when	we	possess it,	because	it	depends	entirely	upon	God's	mercy	and	not	upon	our	actions.	To imagine	we	possess	it	would	lead	us	into	the	sin	of	presumption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	482.	Can	a	person	merit	any	supernatural	reward	for	good	deeds	performed while	he	is	in	mortal	sin?	A.	A	person	cannot	merit	any	supernatural	reward	for good	deeds	performed	while	he	is	in	mortal	sin;	nevertheless,	God	rewards	such good	deeds	by	giving	the	grace	of	repentance;	and,	therefore,	all	persons,	even those	in	mortal	sin,	should	ever	strive	to	do	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	483.	Does	God	reward	anything	but	our	good	works?	A.	God	rewards	our good	intention	and	desire	to	serve	Him,	even	when	our	works	are	not	successful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	should	make	this	good	intention	often	during	the	day,	and	especially	in	the morning. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	484.	How	was	the	true	religion	preserved	from	Adam	till	the	coming	of Christ?	A.	The	true	religion	was	preserved	from	Adam	till	the	coming	of	Christ by	the	patriarchs,	prophets	and	other	holy	men	whom	God	appointed	and inspired	to	teach	His	Will	and	Revelations	to	the	people,	and	to	remind	them	of the	promised	Redeemer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	485.	Who	were	the	prophets,	and	what	was	their	chief	duty?	A.	The	prophets were	men	to	whom	God	gave	a	knowledge	of	future	events	connected	with religion,	that	they	might	foretell	them	to	His	people	and	thus	give	proof	that	the message	came	from	God.	Their	chief	duty	was	to	foretell	the	time,	place	and circumstances	of	Our	Saviour's	coming	into	the	world,	that	men	might	know when	and	where	to	look	for	Him,	and	might	recognize	Him	when	He	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	486.	How	could	they	be	saved	who	lived	before	Christ	became	man?	A.	They who	lived	before	Christ	became	man	could	be	saved	by	belief	in	the	Redeemer to	come	and	by	keeping	the	Commandments	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	487.	Was	the	true	religion	universal	before	the	coming	of	Christ?	A.	The	true religion	was	not	universal	before	the	coming	of	Christ.	It	was	confined	to	one people—the	descendants	of	Abraham.	All	other	nations	worshipped	false	gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	488.	{114}	Which	are	the	means	instituted	by	Our	Lord	to	enable	men	at	all times	to	share	in	the	fruits	of	the	Redemption?	A.	The	means	instituted	by	Our Lord	to	enable	men	at	all	times	to	share	in	the	fruits	of	His	Redemption	are	the Church	and	the	Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	489.	{115}	What	is	the	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	is	the	congregation	of	all	those	who	profess	the	faith	of Christ,	partake	of	the	same	Sacraments,	and	are	governed	by	their	lawful pastors	under	one	visible	Head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	490.	How	may	the	members	of	the	Church	on	earth	be	divided?	A.	The members	of	the	Church	on	earth	may	be	divided	into	those	who	teach	and	those who	are	taught.	Those	who	teach,	namely,	the	Pope,	bishops	and	priests,	are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>called	the	Teaching	Church,	or	simply	the	Church.	Those	who	are	taught	are called	the	Believing	Church,	or	simply	the	faithful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	491.	What	is	the	duty	of	the	Teaching	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	duty	of	the	Teaching	Church	is	to	continue	the	work	Our	Lord began	upon	earth,	namely,	to	teach	revealed	truth,	to	administer	the Sacraments	and	to	labor	for	the	salvation	of	souls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	492.	What	is	the	duty	of	the	faithful?	A.	The	duty	of	the	faithful	is	to	learn	the revealed	truths	taught;	to	receive	the	Sacraments,	and	to	aid	in	saving	souls	by their	prayers,	good	works	and	alms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	493.	What	do	you	mean	by	"profess	the	faith	of	Christ"?	A.	By	"profess	the faith	of	Christ"	we	mean,	believe	all	the	truths	and	practice	the	religion	He	has taught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	494.	What	do	we	mean	by	"lawful	pastors"?	A.	By	"lawful	pastors"	we	mean those	in	the	Church	who	have	been	appointed	by	lawful	authority	and	who	have, therefore,	a	right	to	rule	us.	The	lawful	pastors	in	the	Church	are:	Every	priest	in his	own	parish;	every	bishop	in	his	own	diocese,	and	the	Pope	in	the	whole Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	495.	{116}	Who	is	the	invisible	Head	of	the	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Jesus	Christ	is	the	invisible	Head	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	496.	{117}	Who	is	the	visible	Head	of	the	Church?	A.	Our	Holy	Father	the Pope,	the	Bishop	of	Rome,	is	the	Vicar	of	Christ	on	earth	and	the	visible	Head	of the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	497.	What	does	"vicar"	mean?	A.	Vicar	is	a	name	used	in	the	Church	to designate	a	person	who	acts	in	the	name	and	authority	of	another.	Thus	a	Vicar Apostolic	is	one	who	acts	in	the	name	of	the	Pope,	and	a	Vicar	General	is	one who	acts	in	the	name	of	the	bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	498.	Could	any	one	be	Pope	without	being	Bishop	of	Rome?	A.	One	could not	be	Pope	without	being	Bishop	of	Rome,	and	whoever	is	elected	Pope	must give	up	his	title	to	any	other	diocese	and	take	the	title	of	Bishop	of	Rome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	499.	{118}	Why	is	the	Pope,	the	Bishop	of	Rome,	the	visible	Head	of	the Church?	A.	The	Pope,	the	Bishop	of	Rome,	is	the	visible	Head	of	the	Church</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>because	he	is	the	successor	of	St.	Peter,	whom	Christ	made	the	chief	of	the Apostles	and	the	visible	Head	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	500.	Why	are	Catholics	called	"Roman"?	A.	Catholics	are	called	Roman	to show	that	they	are	in	union	with	the	true	Church	founded	by	Christ	and	governed by	the	Apostles	under	the	direction	of	St.	Peter,	by	divine	appointment	the	Chief of	the	Apostles,	who	founded	the	Church	of	Rome	and	was	its	first	bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	501.	By	what	name	is	a	bishop's	diocese	sometimes	called?	A.	A	bishop's diocese	is	sometimes	called	his	see.	The	diocese	of	Rome,	on	account	of	its authority	and	dignity,	is	called	the	Holy	See,	and	its	bishop	is	called	the	Holy Father	or	Pope.	Pope	means	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	502.	What	do	we	call	the	right	by	which	St.	Peter	or	his	successor	has	always been	the	head	of	the	Church	and	of	all	its	bishops?	A.	We	call	the	right	by	which St.	Peter	or	his	successor	has	always	been	the	head	of	the	Church,	and	of	all	its bishops,	the	Primacy	of	St.	Peter	or	of	the	Pope.	Primacy	means	holding	first place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	503.	How	is	it	shown	that	St.	Peter	or	his	successor	has	always	been	the	head of	the	Church?	A.	It	is	shown	that	St.	Peter	or	his	successor	has	always	been	the head	of	the	Church:	(1)	From	the	words	of	Holy	Scripture,	which	tell	how	Christ appointed	Peter	Chief	of	the	Apostles	and	head	of	the	Church.	(2)	From	the history	of	the	Church,	which	shows	that	Peter	and	his	successors	have	always acted	and	have	always	been	recognized	as	the	head	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	504.	How	do	we	know	that	the	rights	and	privileges	bestowed	on	St.	Peter were	given	also	to	his	successors—the	Popes?	A.	We	know	that	the	rights	and privileges	bestowed	on	St.	Peter	were	given	also	to	his	successors,	the	Popes, because	the	promises	made	to	St.	Peter	by	Our	Lord	were	to	be	fulfilled	in	the Church	till	the	end	of	time,	and	as	Peter	was	not	to	live	till	the	end	of	time,	they are	fulfilled	in	his	successors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	505.	Did	St.	Peter	establish	any	Church	before	he	came	to	Rome?	A.	Before he	came	to	Rome,	St.	Peter	established	a	Church	at	Antioch	and	ruled	over	it	for several	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	506.	{119}	Who	are	the	successors	of	the	other	Apostles? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	successors	of	the	other	Apostles	are	the	Bishops	of	the	Holy Catholic	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>Q.	507.	How	do	we	know	that	the	bishops	of	the	Church	are	the	successors	of the	Apostles?	A.	We	know	that	the	bishops	of	the	Church	are	the	successors	of the	Apostles	because	they	continue	the	work	of	the	Apostles	and	give	proof	of the	same	authority.	They	have	always	exercised	the	rights	and	powers	that belonged	to	the	Apostles	in	making	laws	for	the	Church,	in	consecrating	bishops and	ordaining	priests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	508.	{120}	Why	did	Christ	found	the	Church?	A.	Christ	founded	the	Church to	teach,	govern,	sanctify,	and	save	all	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	509.	{121}	Are	all	bound	to	belong	to	the	Church?	A.	All	are	bound	to belong	to	the	Church,	and	he	who	knows	the	Church	to	be	the	true	Church	and remains	out	of	it	cannot	be	saved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	510.	Is	it	ever	possible	for	one	to	be	saved	who	does	not	know	the	Catholic Church	to	be	the	true	Church?	A.	It	is	possible	for	one	to	be	saved	who	does	not know	the	Catholic	Church	to	be	the	true	Church,	provided	that	person:	(1)	has been	validly	baptized;	(2)	firmly	believes	the	religion	he	professes	and	practices to	be	the	true	religion,	and	(3)	dies	without	the	guilt	of	mortal	sin	on	his	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	511.	Why	do	we	say	it	is	only	possible	for	a	person	to	be	saved	who	does	not know	the	Catholic	Church	to	be	the	true	Church?	A.	We	say	it	is	only	possible for	a	person	to	be	saved	who	does	not	know	the	Catholic	Church	to	be	the	true Church,	because	the	necessary	conditions	are	not	often	found,	especially	that	of dying	in	a	state	of	grace	without	making	use	of	the	Sacrament	of	Penance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	512.	How	are	such	persons	said	to	belong	to	the	Church?	A.	Such	persons	are said	to	belong	to	the	"soul	of	the	church";	that	is,	they	are	really	members	of	the Church	without	knowing	it.	Those	who	share	in	its	Sacraments	and	worship	are said	to	belong	to	the	body	or	visible	part	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	513.	Why	must	the	true	Church	be	visible?	A.	The	true	Church	must	be visible	because	its	founder,	Jesus	Christ,	commanded	us	under	pain	of condemnation	to	hear	the	Church;	and	He	could	not	in	justice	command	us	to hear	a	Church	that	could	not	be	seen	and	known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	514.	What	excuses	do	some	give	for	not	becoming	members	of	the	true Church?	A.	The	excuses	some	give	for	not	becoming	members	of	the	true	church are:	(1)	They	do	not	wish	to	leave	the	religion	in	which	they	were	born;	(2) There	are	too	many	poor	and	ignorant	people	in	the	Catholic	Church;	(3)	One</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>religion	is	as	good	as	another	if	we	try	to	serve	God	in	it,	and	be	upright	and honest	in	our	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	515.	How	do	you	answer	such	excuses?	A.	(1)	To	say	that	we	should	remain in	a	false	religion	because	we	were	born	in	it	is	as	untrue	as	to	say	we	should	not heal	our	bodily	diseases	because	we	were	born	with	them;	(2)	To	say	there	are too	many	poor	and	ignorant	in	the	Catholic	Church	is	to	declare	that	it	is	Christ's Church;	for	He	always	taught	the	poor	and	ignorant	and	instructed	His	Church	to continue	the	work;	(3)	To	say	that	one	religion	is	as	good	as	another	is	to	assert that	Christ	labored	uselessly	and	taught	falsely;	for	He	came	to	abolish	the	old religion	and	found	the	new	in	which	alone	we	can	be	saved	as	He	Himself declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	516.	Why	can	there	be	only	one	true	religion?	A.	There	can	be	only	one	true religion,	because	a	thing	cannot	be	false	and	true	at	the	same	time,	and, therefore,	all	religions	that	contradict	the	teaching	of	the	true	Church	must	teach falsehood.	If	all	religions	in	which	men	seek	to	serve	God	are	equally	good	and true,	why	did	Christ	disturb	the	Jewish	religion	and	the	Apostles	condemn heretics? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	TWELFTH.	ON	THE	ATTRIBUTES	AND	MARKS	OF</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE	CHURCH. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	517.	What	is	an	attribute?	A.	An	attribute	is	any	characteristic	or	quality	that a	person	or	thing	may	be	said	to	have.	All	perfections	or	imperfections	are attributes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	518.	What	is	a	mark?	A.	A	mark	is	a	given	and	known	sign	by	which	a	thing can	be	distinguished	from	all	others	of	its	kind.	Thus	a	trademark	is	used	to distinguish	the	article	bearing	it	from	all	imitations	of	the	same	article. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	519.	How	do	we	know	that	the	Church	must	have	the	four	marks	and	three attributes	usually	ascribed	or	given	to	it?	A.	We	know	that	the	Church	must	have the	four	marks	and	three	attributes	usually	ascribed	or	given	to	it	from	the	words of	Christ	given	in	the	Holy	Scripture	and	in	the	teaching	of	the	Church	from	its beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>Q.	520.	Can	the	Church	have	the	four	marks	without	the	three	attributes?	A.	The Church	cannot	have	the	four	marks	without	the	three	attributes,	because	the	three attributes	necessarily	come	with	the	marks	and	without	them	the	marks	could	not exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	521.	Why	are	both	marks	and	attributes	necessary	in	the	Church?	A.	Both marks	and	attributes	are	necessary	in	the	Church,	for	the	marks	teach	us	its external	or	visible	qualities,	while	the	attributes	teach	us	its	internal	or	invisible qualities.	It	is	easier	to	discover	the	marks	than	the	attributes;	for	it	is	easier	to see	that	the	Church	is	one	than	that	it	is	infallible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	522.	{122}	Which	are	the	attributes	of	the	Church?	A.	The	attributes	of	the Church	are	three:	authority,	infallibility,	and	indefectibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	523.	What	is	authority?	A.	Authority	is	the	power	which	one	person	has	over another	so	as	to	be	able	to	justly	exact	obedience.	Rulers	have	authority	over their	subjects,	parents	over	their	children,	and	teachers	over	their	scholars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	524.	From	whom	must	all	persons	derive	whatever	lawful	authority	they possess? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	All	persons	must	derive	whatever	lawful	authority	they	possess	from God	Himself,	from	whom	they	receive	it	directly	or	indirectly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,	to	disobey	our	lawful	superiors	is	to	disobey	God	Himself, and	hence	such	disobedience	is	always	sinful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	525.	{123}	What	do	you	mean	by	the	authority	of	the	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	By	the	authority	of	the	Church	I	mean	the	right	and	power	which	the Pope	and	the	Bishops,	as	the	successors	of	the	Apostles,	have	to	teach and	to	govern	the	faithful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	526.	{124}	What	do	you	mean	by	the	infallibility	of	the	Church?	A.	By	the infallibility	of	the	Church	I	mean	that	the	Church	can	not	err	when	it	teaches	a doctrine	of	faith	or	morals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	527.	What	do	we	mean	by	a	"doctrine	of	faith	or	morals"?	A.	By	a	doctrine	of faith	or	morals	we	mean	the	revealed	teaching	that	refers	to	whatever	we	must believe	and	do	in	order	to	be	saved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	528.	How	do	you	know	that	the	Church	can	not	err?	A.	I	know	that	the Church	can	not	err	because	Christ	promised	that	the	Holy	Ghost	would	remain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>with	it	forever	and	save	it	from	error.	If,	therefore,	the	Church	has	erred,	the Holy	Ghost	must	have	abandoned	it	and	Christ	has	failed	to	keep	His	promise, which	is	a	thing	impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	529.	Since	the	Church	can	not	err,	could	it	ever	be	reformed	in	its	teaching	of faith	or	morals?	A.	Since	the	Church	can	not	err,	it	could	never	be	reformed	in	its teaching	of	faith	or	morals.	Those	who	say	the	Church	needed	reformation	in faith	or	morals	accuse	Our	Lord	of	falsehood	and	deception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	530.	{125}	When	does	the	Church	teach	infallibly? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	teaches	infallibly	when	it	speaks	through	the	Pope	and Bishops	united	in	general	council,	or	through	the	Pope	alone	when	he proclaims	to	all	the	faithful	a	doctrine	of	faith	or	morals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	531.	What	is	necessary	that	the	Pope	may	speak	infallibly	or	ex-cathedra?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	the	Pope	may	speak	infallibly,	or	ex-cathedra,	(1)	He	must	speak	on	a subject	of	faith	or	morals;	(2)	He	must	speak	as	the	Vicar	of	Christ	and	to	the whole	Church;	(3)	He	must	indicate	by	certain	words,	such	as,	we	define,	we proclaim,	&amp;c.,	that	he	intends	to	speak	infallibly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	532.	Is	the	Pope	infallible	in	everything	he	says	and	does?	A.	The	Pope	is	not infallible	in	everything	he	says	and	does,	because	the	Holy	Ghost	was	not promised	to	make	him	infallible	in	everything,	but	only	in	matters	of	faith	and morals	for	the	whole	Church.	Nevertheless,	the	Pope's	opinion	on	any	subject deserves	our	greatest	respect	on	account	of	his	learning,	experience	and	dignity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	533.	Can	the	Pope	commit	sin?	A.	The	Pope	can	commit	sin	and	he	must	seek forgiveness	in	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	as	others	do.	Infallibility	does	not prevent	him	from	sinning,	but	from	teaching	falsehood	when	he	speaks	ex-cathedra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	534.	What	does	ex-cathedra	mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	"Cathedra"	means	a	seat,	and	"ex"	means	out	of.	Therefore, ex-cathedra	means	speaking	from	the	seat	or	official	place	held	by	St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	and	his	successors	as	the	head	of	the	whole	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	535.	Why	is	the	chief	Church	in	a	diocese	called	a	Cathedral?	A.	The	chief Church	in	a	diocese	is	called	a	Cathedral	because	the	bishop's	cathedra,	that	is, his	seat	or	throne,	is	erected	in	it,	and	because	he	celebrates	all	important	feasts and	performs	all	his	special	duties	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>Q.	536.	How	many	Popes	have	governed	the	Church	from	St.	Peter	to	Pius	XI.? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	From	St.	Peter	to	Pius	XI.,	261	Popes	have	governed	the	Church;	and	many of	them	have	been	remarkable	for	their	zeal,	prudence,	learning	and	sanctity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	537.	What	does	anti-pope	mean,	and	who	were	the	anti-popes?	A.	Anti-pope means	a	pretended	pope.	The	anti-popes	were	men	who	by	the	aid	of	faithless Christians	or	others	unlawfully	seized	and	claimed	the	papal	power	while	the lawful	pope	was	in	prison	or	exile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	538.	Why	must	the	Pope	sometimes	warn	us	on	political	and	other	matters? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Pope	must	sometimes	warn	us	on	political	and	other	matters,	because whatever	nations	or	men	do	is	either	good	or	bad,	just	or	unjust,	and	wherever the	Pope	discovers	falsehood,	wickedness	or	injustice	he	must	speak	against	it and	defend	the	truths	of	faith	and	morals.	He	must	protect	also	the	temporal rights	and	property	of	the	Church	committed	to	his	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	539.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"temporal	power"	of	the	Pope?	A.	By	the temporal	power	of	the	Pope	we	mean	the	right	which	the	Pope	has	as	a	temporal or	ordinary	ruler	to	govern	the	states	and	manage	the	properties	that	have rightfully	come	into	the	possession	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	540.	How	did	the	Pope	acquire	and	how	was	he	deprived	of	the	temporal power?	A.	The	Pope	acquired	the	temporal	power	in	a	just	manner	by	the consent	of	those	who	had	a	right	to	bestow	it.	He	was	deprived	of	it	in	an	unjust manner	by	political	changes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	541.	How	was	the	temporal	power	useful	to	the	Church?	A.	The	temporal power	was	useful	to	the	Church	(1)	because	it	gave	the	Pope	the	complete independence	necessary	for	the	government	of	the	Church	and	for	the	defense	of truth	and	virtue.	(2)	It	enabled	him	to	do	much	for	the	spread	of	the	true	religion by	giving	alms	for	the	establishment	and	support	of	Churches	and	schools	in poor	or	pagan	countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	542.	What	name	do	we	give	to	the	offerings	made	yearly	by	the	faithful	for the	support	of	the	Pope	and	the	government	of	the	Church?	A.	We	call	the offerings	made	yearly	by	the	faithful	for	the	support	of	the	Pope	and	government of	the	Church	"Peter's	pence."	It	derives	its	name	from	the	early	custom	of sending	yearly	a	penny	from	every	house	to	the	successor	of	St.	Peter,	as	a	mark of	respect	or	as	an	alms	for	some	charity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>Q.	543.	{126}	What	do	you	mean	by	the	indefectibility	of	the	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	By	the	indefectibility	of	the	Church	I	mean	that	the	Church,	as Christ	founded	it,	will	last	till	the	end	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	544.	What	is	the	difference	between	the	infallibility	and	indefectibility	of	the Church?	A.	When	we	say	the	Church	is	infallible	we	mean	that	it	can	never teach	error	while	it	lasts;	but	when	we	say	the	Church	is	indefectible,	we	mean that	it	will	last	forever	and	be	infallible	forever;	that	it	will	always	remain	as	Our Lord	founded	it	and	never	change	the	doctrines	He	taught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	545.	Did	Our	Lord	Himself	make	all	the	laws	of	the	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Our	Lord	Himself	did	not	make	all	the	laws	of	the	Church.	He	gave	the Church	also	power	to	make	laws	to	suit	the	needs	of	the	times,	places	or persons	as	it	judged	necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	546.	Can	the	Church	change	its	laws? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	can,	when	necessary,	change	the	laws	it	has	itself	made, but	it	cannot	change	the	laws	that	Christ	has	made.	Neither	can	the Church	change	any	doctrine	of	faith	or	morals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	547.	{127}	In	whom	are	these	attributes	found	in	their	fullness?	A.	These attributes	are	found	in	their	fullness	in	the	Pope,	the	visible	Head	of	the	Church, whose	infallible	authority	to	teach	bishops,	priests,	and	people	in	matters	of	faith or	morals	will	last	to	the	end	of	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	548.	{128}	Has	the	Church	any	marks	by	which	it	may	be	known? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	has	four	marks	by	which	it	may	be	known:	it	is	One;	it	is Holy;	it	is	Catholic;	it	is	Apostolic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	549.	{129}	How	is	the	Church	One?	A.	The	Church	is	One	because	all	its members	agree	in	one	faith,	are	all	in	one	communion,	and	are	all	under	one head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	550.	How	is	it	evident	that	the	Church	is	one	in	government?	A.	It	is	evident that	the	Church	is	one	in	government,	for	the	faithful	in	a	parish	are	subject	to their	pastors,	the	pastors	are	subject	to	the	bishops	of	their	dioceses,	and	the bishops	of	the	world	are	subject	to	the	Pope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	551.	What	is	meant	by	the	Hierarchy	of	the	Church?	A.	By	the	Hierarchy	of the	Church	is	meant	the	sacred	body	of	clerical	rules	who	govern	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>Q.	552.	How	is	it	evident	that	the	Church	is	one	in	worship?	A.	It	is	evident	that the	Church	is	one	in	worship	because	all	its	members	make	use	of	the	same sacrifice	and	receive	the	same	Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	553.	How	is	it	evident	that	the	Church	is	one	in	faith?	A.	It	is	evident	the Church	is	one	in	faith	because	all	Catholics	throughout	the	world	believe	each and	every	article	of	faith	proposed	by	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	554.	Could	a	person	who	denies	only	one	article	of	our	faith	be	a Catholic? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	A	person	who	denies	even	one	article	of	our	faith	could	not	be	a Catholic;	for	truth	is	one	and	we	must	accept	it	whole	and	entire	or	not at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	555.	Are	there	any	pious	beliefs	and	practices	in	the	Church	that	are	not articles	of	faith?	A.	There	are	many	pious	beliefs	and	practices	in	the	Church that	are	not	articles	of	faith;	that	is,	we	are	not	bound	under	pain	of	sin	to	believe in	them;	yet	we	will	often	find	them	useful	aids	to	holiness,	and	hence	they	are recommended	by	our	pastors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	556.	Of	what	sin	are	persons	guilty	who	put	firm	belief	in	religious	or	other practices	that	are	either	forbidden	or	useless?	A.	Persons	who	put	a	firm	belief	in religious	or	other	practices	that	are	forbidden	or	useless	are	guilty	of	the	sin	of superstition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	557.	Where	does	the	Church	find	the	revealed	truths	it	is	bound	to teach? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	finds	the	revealed	truths	it	is	bound	to	teach	in	the	Holy Scripture	and	revealed	traditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	558.	What	is	the	Holy	Scripture	or	Bible? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Holy	Scripture	or	Bible	is	the	collection	of	sacred,	inspired writings	through	which	God	has	made	known	to	us	many	revealed	truths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	call	them	letters	from	Heaven	to	earth,	that	is,	from	God	to	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	559.	What	is	meant	by	the	Canon	of	the	Sacred	Scriptures?	A.	The	Canon	of Sacred	Scriptures	means	the	list	the	Church	has	prepared	to	teach	us	what	sacred writings	are	Holy	Scripture	and	contain	the	inspired	word	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	560.	Where	does	the	Church	find	the	revealed	traditions?	A.	The	Church</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>finds	the	revealed	traditions	in	the	decrees	of	its	councils;	in	its	books	of worship;	in	its	paintings	and	inscriptions	on	tombs	and	monuments;	in	the	lives of	its	Saints;	the	writings	of	its	Fathers,	and	in	its	own	history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	561.	Must	we	ourselves	seek	in	the	Scriptures	and	traditions	for	what	we	are to	believe?	A.	We	ourselves	need	not	seek	in	the	Scriptures	and	traditions	for what	we	are	to	believe.	God	has	appointed	the	Church	to	be	our	guide	to salvation	and	we	must	accept	its	teaching	us	our	infallible	rule	of	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	562.	How	do	we	show	that	the	Holy	Scriptures	alone	could	not	be	our	guide to	salvation	and	infallible	rule	of	faith?	A.	We	show	that	the	Holy	Scripture alone	could	not	be	our	guide	to	salvation	and	infallible	rule	of	faith:	(1)	Because all	men	cannot	examine	or	understand	the	Holy	Scripture;	but	all	can	listen	to	the teaching	of	the	Church;	(2)	Because	the	New	Testament	or	Christian	part	of	the Scripture	was	not	written	at	the	beginning	of	the	Church's	existence,	and, therefore,	could	not	have	been	used	as	the	rule	of	faith	by	the	first	Christians;	(3) Because	there	are	many	things	in	the	Holy	Scripture	that	cannot	be	understood without	the	explanation	given	by	tradition,	and	hence	those	who	take	the Scripture	alone	for	their	rule	of	faith	are	constantly	disputing	about	its	meaning and	what	they	are	to	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	563.	{130}	How	is	the	Church	Holy?	A.	The	Church	is	Holy	because	its founder,	Jesus	Christ,	is	holy;	because	it	teaches	a	holy	doctrine;	invites	all	to	a holy	life;	and	because	of	the	eminent	holiness	of	so	many	thousands	of	its children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	564.	{131}	How	is	the	Church	Catholic	or	universal?	A.	The	Church	is Catholic	or	universal	because	it	subsists	in	all	ages,	teaches	all	nations,	and maintains	all	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	565.	How	do	you	show	that	the	Catholic	Church	is	universal	in	time,	in	place, and	in	doctrine?	A.	(1)	The	Catholic	Church	is	universal	in	time,	for	from	the time	of	the	Apostles	to	the	present	it	has	existed,	taught	and	labored	in	every age;	(2)	It	is	universal	in	place,	for	it	has	taught	throughout	the	whole	world;	(3) It	is	universal	in	doctrine,	for	it	teaches	the	same	everywhere,	and	its	doctrines are	suited	to	all	classes	of	persons.	It	has	converted	all	the	pagan	nations	that have	ever	been	converted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	566.	Why	does	the	Church	use	the	Latin	language	instead	of	the	national</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>language	of	its	children?	A.	The	Church	uses	the	Latin	language	instead	of	the national	language	of	its	children:	(1)	To	avoid	the	danger	of	changing	any	part	of its	teaching	in	using	different	languages;	(2)	That	all	its	rulers	may	be	perfectly united	and	understood	in	their	communications;	(3)	To	show	that	the	Church	is not	an	institute	of	any	particular	nation,	but	the	guide	of	all	nations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	567.	{132}	How	is	the	Church	Apostolic? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	is	Apostolic	because	it	was	founded	by	Christ	on	His Apostles,	and	is	governed	by	their	lawful	successors,	and	because	it	has never	ceased,	and	never	will	cease,	to	teach	their	doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	568.	Does	the	Church,	by	defining	certain	truths,	thereby	make	new doctrines?	A.	The	Church,	by	defining,	that	is,	by	proclaiming	certain	truths, articles	of	faith,	does	not	make	new	doctrines,	but	simply	teaches	more	clearly and	with	greater	effort	truths	that	have	always	been	believed	and	held	by	the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	569.	What,	then,	is	the	use	of	defining	or	declaring	a	truth	an	article	of	faith	if it	has	always	been	believed?	A.	The	use	of	defining	or	declaring	a	truth	an	article of	faith,	even	when	it	has	always	been	believed,	is:	(1)	To	clearly	contradict those	who	deny	it	and	show	their	teaching	false;	(2)	To	remove	all	doubt	about the	exact	teaching	of	the	Church,	and	to	put	an	end	to	all	discussion	about	the truth	defined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	570.	{133}	In	which	Church	are	these	attributes	and	marks	found? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	These	attributes	and	marks	are	found	in	the	Holy	Roman	Catholic Church	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	571.	How	do	you	show	that	Protestant	Churches	have	not	the	marks	of the	true	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Protestant	Churches	have	not	the	marks	of	the	true	Church,	because: (1)	They	are	not	one	either	in	government	or	faith;	for	they	have	no	chief	head, and	they	profess	different	beliefs;	(2)	They	are	not	holy,	because	their	doctrines are	founded	on	error	and	lead	to	evil	consequences;	(3)	They	are	not	catholic	or universal	in	time,	place	or	doctrine.	They	have	not	existed	in	all	ages	nor	in	all places,	and	their	doctrines	do	not	suit	all	classes;	(4)	They	are	not	apostolic,	for they	were	not	established	for	hundreds	of	years	after	the	Apostles,	and	they	do not	teach	the	doctrines	of	the	Apostles. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>Q.	572.	{134}	From	whom	does	the	Church	derive	its	undying	life	and infallible	authority? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	derives	its	undying	life	and	infallible	authority	from	the Holy	Ghost,	the	spirit	of	truth,	who	abides	with	it	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	573.	{135}	By	whom	is	the	Church	made	and	kept	One,	Holy,	and Catholic? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	is	made	and	kept	One,	Holy,	and	Catholic	by	the	Holy Ghost,	the	spirit	of	love	and	holiness,	who	unites	and	sanctifies	its members	throughout	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	THIRTEENTH.	ON	THE	SACRAMENTS	IN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">GENERAL. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	574.	{136}	What	is	a	Sacrament? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	A	Sacrament	is	an	outward	sign	instituted	by	Christ	to	give	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	575.	Are	these	three	things,	namely:	An	outward	or	visible	sign,	the institution	of	that	sign	by	Christ,	and	the	giving	of	grace	through	the	use	of	that sign,	always	necessary	for	the	existence	of	a	Sacrament?	A.	These	three	things, namely:	An	outward	or	visible	sign,	the	institution	of	that	sign	by	Christ,	and	the giving	of	grace	through	the	use	of	that	sign,	are	always	necessary	for	the existence	of	a	Sacrament,	and	if	any	of	the	three	be	wanting	there	can	be	no Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	576.	Why	does	the	Church	use	numerous	ceremonies	or	actions	in	applying the	outward	signs	of	the	Sacraments?	A.	The	Church	uses	numerous	ceremonies or	actions	in	applying	the	outward	signs	of	the	Sacraments	to	increase	our reverence	and	devotion	for	the	Sacraments,	and	to	explain	their	meaning	and effects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	577.	{137}	How	many	Sacraments	are	there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	There	are	seven	Sacraments:	Baptism,	Confirmation,	Holy	Eucharist, Penance,	Extreme	Unction,	Holy	Orders,	and	Matrimony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	578.	Were	all	the	Sacraments	instituted	by	Our	Lord?	A.	All	the	Sacraments</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>were	instituted	by	Our	Lord,	for	God	alone	has	power	to	attach	the	gift	of	grace to	the	use	of	an	outward	or	visible	sign.	The	Church,	however,	can	institute	the ceremonies	to	be	used	in	administering	or	giving	the	Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	579.	How	do	we	know	there	are	seven	Sacraments	and	no	more	or	less? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	know	there	are	seven	Sacraments	and	no	more	or	less	because	the Church	always	taught	that	truth.	The	number	of	the	Sacraments	is	a matter	of	faith,	and	the	Church	cannot	be	mistaken	in	matters	of	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	580.	Why	have	the	Sacraments	been	instituted?	A.	The	Sacraments	have	been instituted	as	a	special	means	through	which	we	are	to	receive	the	grace	merited for	us	by	Christ.	As	Christ	is	the	giver	of	the	grace,	He	has	the	right	to	determine the	manner	in	which	it	shall	be	given,	and	one	who	refuses	to	make	use	of	the Sacraments	will	not	receive	God's	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	581.	Do	the	Sacraments	recall	in	any	way	the	means	by	which	Our	Lord merited	the	graces	we	receive	through	them?	A.	The	Sacraments	recall	in	many ways	the	means	by	which	Our	Lord	merited	the	graces	we	receive	through	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Baptism	recalls	His	profound	humility;	Confirmation	His	ceaseless	prayer;	Holy Eucharist	His	care	of	the	needy;	Penance	His	mortified	life;	Extreme	Unction His	model	death;	Holy	Orders	His	establishment	of	the	priesthood,	and Matrimony	His	close	union	with	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	582.	Give,	for	example,	the	outward	sign	in	Baptism	and	Confirmation.	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	outward	sign	in	Baptism	is	the	pouring	of	the	water	and	the	saying	of	the words	of	Baptism.	The	outward	sign	in	Confirmation	is	the	anointing	with	oil, the	saying	of	the	words	of	Confirmation	and	the	placing	of	the	bishop's	hands over	the	person	he	confirms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	583.	What	is	the	use	of	the	outward	signs	in	the	Sacraments?	A.	Without	the outward	signs	in	the	Sacraments	we	could	not	know	when	or	with	what	effect the	grace	of	the	Sacraments	enters	into	our	souls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	584.	Does	the	outward	sign	merely	indicate	that	grace	has	been	given,	or	does the	use	of	the	outward	sign	with	the	proper	intention	also	give	the	grace	of	the Sacrament?	A.	The	outward	sign	is	not	used	merely	to	indicate	that	grace	has been	given,	for	the	use	of	the	outward	sign	with	the	proper	intention	also	gives the	grace	of	the	Sacrament.	Hence	the	right	application	of	the	outward	sign	is always	followed	by	the	gift	of	internal	grace	if	the	Sacrament	be	administered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>with	the	right	intention	and	received	with	the	right	dispositions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	585.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"right	intention"	for	the	administration	of	the Sacraments?	A.	By	the	right	intention	for	the	administration	of	the	Sacraments we	mean	that	whoever	administers	a	Sacrament	must	have	the	intention	of	doing what	Christ	intended	when	He	instituted	the	Sacrament	and	what	the	Church intends	when	it	administers	the	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	586.	Is	there	any	likeness	between	the	thing	used	in	the	outward	sign	and	the grace	given	in	each	Sacrament?	A.	There	is	a	great	likeness	between	the	thing used	in	the	outward	sign	and	the	grace	given	in	each	Sacrament;	thus	water	is used	for	cleansing;	Baptism	cleanses	the	soul;	Oil	gives	strength	and	light; Confirmation	strengthens	and	enlightens	the	soul;	Bread	and	wine	nourish;	the Holy	Eucharist	nourishes	the	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	587.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"matter	and	form"	of	the	Sacraments?	A.	By the	"matter"	of	the	Sacraments	we	mean	the	visible	things,	such	as	water,	oil, bread,	wine,	&amp;c.,	used	for	the	Sacraments.	By	the	"form"	we	mean	the	words, such	as	"I	baptize	thee,"	"I	confirm	thee,"	&amp;c.,	used	in	giving	or	administering the	Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	588.	Do	the	needs	of	the	soul	resemble	the	needs	of	the	body?	A.	The	needs of	the	soul	do	resemble	the	needs	of	the	body;	for	the	body	must	be	born, strengthened,	nourished,	healed	in	affliction,	helped	at	the	hour	of	death,	guided by	authority,	and	given	a	place	in	which	to	dwell.	The	soul	is	brought	into spiritual	life	by	Baptism;	it	is	strengthened	by	Confirmation;	nourished	by	the Holy	Eucharist;	healed	by	Penance;	helped	at	the	hour	of	our	death	by	Extreme Unction;	guided	by	God's	ministers	through	the	Sacrament	of	Holy	Orders,	and it	is	given	a	body	in	which	to	dwell	by	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	589.	{138}	Whence	have	the	Sacraments	the	power	of	giving	grace? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Sacraments	have	the	power	of	giving	grace	from	the	merits	of Jesus	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	590.	Does	the	effect	of	the	Sacraments	depend	on	the	worthiness	or unworthiness	of	the	one	who	administers	them?	A.	The	effect	of	the	Sacraments does	not	depend	on	the	worthiness	or	unworthiness	of	the	one	who	administers them,	but	on	the	merits	of	Jesus	Christ,	who	instituted	them,	and	on	the	worthy dispositions	of	those	who	receive	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>Q.	591.	{139}	What	grace	do	the	Sacraments	give?	A.	Some	of	the	Sacraments give	sanctifying	grace,	and	others	increase	it	in	our	souls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	592.	When	is	a	Sacrament	said	to	give,	and	when	is	it	said	to	increase,	grace in	our	souls?	A.	A	Sacrament	is	said	to	give	grace	when	there	is	no	grace whatever	in	the	soul,	or	in	other	words,	when	the	soul	is	in	mortal	sin.	A Sacrament	is	said	to	increase	grace	when	there	is	already	grace	in	the	soul,	to which	more	is	added	by	the	Sacrament	received. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	593.	{140}	Which	are	the	Sacraments	that	give	sanctifying	grace?	A.	The Sacraments	that	give	sanctifying	grace	are	Baptism	and	Penance;	and	they	are called	Sacraments	of	the	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	594.	{141}	Why	are	Baptism	and	Penance	called	Sacraments	of	the	dead?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Baptism	and	Penance	are	called	Sacraments	of	the	dead	because	they	take	away sin,	which	is	the	death	of	the	soul,	and	give	grace,	which	is	its	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	595.	May	not	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	be	received	by	one	who	is	in	a state	of	grace? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Sacrament	of	Penance	may	be	and	very	often	is	received	by	one	who is	in	a	state	of	grace,	and	when	thus	received	it	increases—as	the Sacraments	of	the	living	do—the	grace	already	in	the	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	596.	{142}	Which	are	the	Sacraments	that	increase	sanctifying	grace in	our	soul? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Sacraments	that	increase	sanctifying	grace	in	our	souls	are: Confirmation,	Holy	Eucharist,	Extreme	Unction,	Holy	Orders,	and Matrimony;	and	they	are	called	Sacraments	of	the	living. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	597.	What	do	we	mean	by	Sacraments	of	the	dead	and	Sacraments	of	the living?	A.	By	the	Sacraments	of	the	dead	we	mean	those	Sacraments	that	may	be lawfully	received	while	the	soul	is	in	a	state	of	mortal	sin.	By	the	Sacraments	of the	living	we	mean	those	Sacraments	that	can	be	lawfully	received	only	while the	soul	is	in	a	state	of	grace—i.e.,	free	from	mortal	sin.	Living	and	dead	do	not refer	here	to	the	persons,	but	to	the	condition	of	the	souls;	for	none	of	the Sacraments	can	be	given	to	a	dead	person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	598.	{143}	Why	are	Confirmation,	Holy	Eucharist,	Extreme	Unction, Holy	Orders,	and	Matrimony	called	Sacraments	of	the	living? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Confirmation,	Holy	Eucharist,	Extreme	Unction,	Holy	Orders,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>Matrimony	are	called	Sacraments	of	the	living	because	those	who	receive them	worthily	are	already	living	the	life	of	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	599.	{144}	What	sin	does	he	commit	who	receives	the	Sacraments	of	the living	in	mortal	sin?	A.	He	who	receives	the	Sacraments	of	the	living	in	mortal sin	commits	a	sacrilege,	which	is	a	great	sin,	because	it	is	an	abuse	of	a	sacred thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	600.	In	what	other	ways	besides	the	unworthy	reception	of	the	Sacraments may	persons	commit	sacrilege?	A.	Besides	the	unworthy	reception	of	the Sacraments,	persons	may	commit	sacrilege	by	the	abuse	of	a	sacred	person, place	or	thing;	for	example,	by	wilfully	wounding	a	person	consecrated	to	God; by	robbing	or	destroying	a	Church;	by	using	the	sacred	vessels	of	the	Altar	for unlawful	purposes,	&amp;c. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	601.	{145}	Besides	sanctifying	grace	do	the	Sacraments	give	any	other grace? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Besides	sanctifying	grace	the	Sacraments	give	another	grace,	called sacramental	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	602.	{146}	What	is	sacramental	grace?	A.	Sacramental	grace	is	a	special	help which	God	gives,	to	attain	the	end	for	which	He	instituted	each	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	603.	Is	the	Sacramental	grace	independent	of	the	sanctifying	grace	given	in the	Sacraments?	A.	The	Sacramental	grace	is	not	independent	of	the	sanctifying grace	given	in	the	Sacraments;	for	it	is	the	sanctifying	grace	that	gives	us	a certain	right	to	special	helps—called	Sacramental	grace—in	each	Sacrament,	as often	as	we	have	to	fulfill	the	end	of	the	Sacrament	or	are	tempted	against	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	604.	Give	an	example	of	how	the	Sacramental	grace	aids	us,	for	instance,	in Confirmation	and	Penance.	A.	The	end	of	Confirmation	is	to	strengthen	us	in	our faith.	When	we	are	tempted	to	deny	our	religion	by	word	or	deed,	the Sacramental	Grace	of	Confirmation	is	given	to	us	and	helps	us	to	cling	to	our faith	and	firmly	profess	it.	The	end	of	Penance	is	to	destroy	actual	sin.	When	we are	tempted	to	sin,	the	Sacramental	Grace	of	Penance	is	given	to	us	and	helps	us to	overcome	the	temptation	and	persevere	in	a	state	of	grace.	The	sacramental grace	in	each	of	the	other	Sacraments	is	given	in	the	same	manner,	and	aids	us	in attaining	the	end	for	which	each	Sacrament	was	instituted	and	for	which	we receive	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>Q.	605.	{147}	Do	the	Sacraments	always	give	grace?	A.	The	Sacraments	always give	grace,	if	we	receive	them	with	the	right	dispositions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	606.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"right	dispositions"	for	the	reception	of the	Sacraments? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	By	the	right	dispositions	for	the	reception	of	the	Sacraments	we	mean the	proper	motives	and	the	fulfillment	of	all	the	conditions	required	by God	and	the	Church	for	the	worthy	reception	of	the	Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	607.	Give	an	example	of	the	"right	dispositions"	for	Penance	and	for	the	Holy Eucharist.	A.	The	right	dispositions	for	Penance	are:	(1)	To	confess	all	our mortal	sins	as	we	know	them;	(2)	To	be	sorry	for	them,	and	(3)	To	have	the determination	never	to	commit	them	or	others	again.	The	right	dispositions	for the	Holy	Eucharist	are:	(1)	To	know	what	the	Holy	Eucharist	is;	(2)	To	be	in	a state	of	grace,	and	(3)—except	in	special	cases	of	sickness—to	be	fasting	from midnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	608.	{148}	Can	we	receive	the	Sacraments	more	than	once? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	can	receive	the	Sacraments	more	than	once,	except	Baptism, Confirmation,	and	Holy	Orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	609.	{149}	Why	can	we	not	receive	Baptism,	Confirmation,	and	Holy Orders	more	than	once? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	cannot	receive	Baptism,	Confirmation,	and	Holy	Orders	more	than once,	because	they	imprint	a	character	in	the	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	610.	{150}	What	is	the	character	which	these	Sacraments	imprint	in the	soul? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	character	which	these	Sacraments	imprint	in	the	soul	is	a spiritual	mark	which	remains	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	611.	{151}	Does	this	character	remain	in	the	soul	even	after	death?	A.	This character	remains	in	the	soul	even	after	death;	for	the	honor	and	glory	of	those who	are	saved;	for	the	shame	and	punishment	of	those	who	are	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	612.	Can	the	Sacraments	be	given	conditionally?	A.	The	Sacraments	can	be given	conditionally	as	often	as	we	doubt	whether	they	were	properly	given before,	or	whether	they	can	be	validly	given	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	613.	What	do	we	mean	by	giving	a	Sacrament	conditionally?	A.	By	giving	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>Sacrament	conditionally	we	mean	that	the	person	administering	the	Sacrament intends	to	give	it	only	in	case	it	has	not	been	given	already	or	in	case	the	person has	the	right	dispositions	for	receiving	it,	though	the	dispositions	cannot	be discovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	614.	Give	an	example	of	how	a	Sacrament	is	given	conditionally.	A.	In	giving Baptism,	for	instance,	conditionally—or	what	we	call	conditional	Baptism—the priest,	instead	of	saying	absolutely,	as	he	does	in	ordinary	Baptism:	"I	baptize thee,"	&amp;c.,	says:	"If	you	are	not	already	baptized,	or	if	you	are	capable	of	being baptized,	I	baptize	thee,"	&amp;c.,	thus	stating	the	sole	condition	on	which	he	intends to	administer	the	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	615.	Which	of	the	Sacraments	are	most	frequently	given	conditionally?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Sacraments	most	frequently	given	conditionally	are	Baptism,	Penance	and Extreme	Unction;	because	in	some	cases	it	is	difficult	to	ascertain	whether	these Sacraments	have	been	given	before	or	whether	they	have	been	validly	given,	or whether	the	person	about	to	receive	them	has	the	right	dispositions	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	616.	Name	some	of	the	more	common	circumstances	in	which	a	priest	is obliged	to	administer	the	Sacraments	conditionally.	A.	Some	of	the	more common	circumstances	in	which	a	priest	is	obliged	to	administer	the	Sacraments conditionally	are:	(1)	When	he	receives	converts	into	the	Church	and	is	not certain	of	their	previous	baptism,	he	must	baptize	them	conditionally.	(2)	When he	is	called—as	in	cases	of	accident	or	sudden	illness—and	doubts	whether	the person	be	alive	or	dead,	or	whether	he	should	be	given	the	Sacraments,	he	must give	absolution	and	administer	Extreme	Unction	conditionally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	617.	What	is	the	use	and	effect	of	giving	the	Sacraments	conditionally?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	use	of	giving	the	Sacraments	conditionally	is	that	there	may	be	no irreverence	to	the	Sacraments	in	giving	them	to	persons	incapable	or	unworthy of	receiving	them;	and	yet	that	no	one	who	is	capable	or	worthy	may	be	deprived of	them.	The	effect	is	to	supply	the	Sacrament	where	it	is	needed	or	can	be given,	and	to	withhold	it	where	it	is	not	needed	or	cannot	be	given. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	618.	What	is	the	difference	between	the	powers	of	a	bishop	and	of	a	priest with	regard	to	the	administration	of	the	Sacraments?	A.	The	difference	between the	powers	of	a	bishop	and	of	a	priest	with	regard	to	the	administration	of	the Sacraments	is	that	a	bishop	can	give	all	the	Sacraments,	while	a	priest	cannot give	Confirmation	or	Holy	Orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>Q.	619.	Can	a	person	receive	all	the	Sacraments?	A.	A	person	cannot,	as	a	rule, receive	all	the	Sacraments;	for	a	woman	cannot	receive	Holy	Orders,	and	a	man who	receives	priesthood	is	forbidden	to	receive	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	FOURTEENTH.	ON	BAPTISM. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	620.	When	was	baptism	instituted?	A.	Baptism	was	instituted,	very	probably, about	the	time	Our	Lord	was	baptized	by	St.	John,	and	its	reception	was commanded	when	after	His	resurrection	Our	Lord	said	to	His	Apostles:	"All power	is	given	to	Me	in	heaven	and	in	earth.	Going,	therefore,	teach	all	nations, baptizing	them	in	the	name	of	the	Father,	and	of	the	Son,	and	of	the	Holy Ghost." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	621.	{152}	What	is	Baptism? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Baptism	is	a	Sacrament	which	cleanses	us	from	original	sin,	makes	us Christians,	children	of	God,	and	heirs	of	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	622.	What	were	persons	called	in	the	first	ages	of	the	Church	who	were	being instructed	and	prepared	for	baptism?	A.	Persons	who	were	being	instructed	and prepared	for	baptism,	in	the	first	ages	of	the	Church,	were	called	catechumens, and	they	are	frequently	mentioned	in	Church	history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	623.	What	persons	are	called	heirs?	A.	All	persons	who	inherit	or	come lawfully	into	the	possession	of	property	or	goods	at	the	death	of	another,	are called	heirs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	624.	Why,	then,	are	we	the	heirs	of	Christ?	A.	We	are	the	heirs	of	Christ because	at	His	death	we	came	into	the	possession	of	God's	friendship,	of	grace, and	of	the	right	to	enter	heaven,	provided	we	comply	with	the	conditions	Our Lord	has	laid	down	for	the	gaining	of	this	inheritance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	625.	What	conditions	has	Our	Lord	laid	down	for	the	gaining	of	this inheritance?	A.	The	conditions	Our	Lord	has	laid	down	for	the	gaining	of	this inheritance	are:	(1)	That	we	receive,	when	possible,	the	Sacraments	He	has instituted;	and	(2)	That	we	believe	and	practice	all	He	has	taught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	626.	Did	not	St.	John	the	Baptist	institute	the	Sacrament	of	Baptism?	A.	St. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>John	the	Baptist	did	not	institute	the	Sacrament	of	Baptism,	for	Christ	alone could	institute	a	Sacrament.	The	baptism	given	by	St.	John	had	the	effect	of	a Sacramental;	that	is,	it	did	not	of	itself	give	grace,	but	prepared	the	way	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	627.	{153}	Are	actual	sins	ever	remitted	by	Baptism? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Actual	sins	and	all	the	punishment	due	to	them	are	remitted	by Baptism,	if	the	person	baptized	be	guilty	of	any. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	628.	That	actual	sins	may	be	remitted	by	baptism,	is	it	necessary	to be	sorry	for	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	That	actual	sins	may	be	remitted	by	baptism	it	is	necessary	to	be sorry	for	them,	just	as	we	must	be	when	they	are	remitted	by	the Sacrament	of	Penance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	629.	What	punishments	are	due	to	actual	sins?	A.	Two	punishments	are	due	to actual	sins:	one,	called	the	eternal,	is	inflicted	in	hell;	and	the	other,	called	the temporal,	is	inflicted	in	this	world	or	in	purgatory.	The	Sacrament	of	Penance remits	or	frees	us	from	the	eternal	punishment	and	generally	only	from	part	of the	temporal.	Prayer,	good	works	and	indulgences	in	this	world	and	the sufferings	of	purgatory	in	the	next	remit	the	remainder	of	the	temporal punishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	630.	Why	is	there	a	double	punishment	attached	to	actual	sins?	There	is	a double	punishment	attached	to	actual	sins,	because	in	their	commission	there	is	a double	guilt:	(1)	Of	insulting	God	and	of	turning	away	from	Him;	(2)	Of depriving	Him	of	the	honor	we	owe	Him,	and	of	turning	to	His	enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	631.	{154}	Is	Baptism	necessary	to	salvation?	A.	Baptism	is	necessary	to salvation,	because	without	it	we	cannot	enter	into	the	kingdom	of	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	632.	Where	will	persons	go	who—such	as	infants—have	not	committed actual	sin	and	who,	through	no	fault	of	theirs,	die	without	baptism?	A.	Persons, such	as	infants,	who	have	not	committed	actual	sin	and	who,	through	no	fault	of theirs,	die	without	baptism,	cannot	enter	heaven;	but	it	is	the	common	belief	they will	go	to	some	place	similar	to	Limbo,	where	they	will	be	free	from	suffering, though	deprived	of	the	happiness	of	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	633.	{155}	Who	can	administer	Baptism?	A.	A	priest	is	the	ordinary	minister of	baptism;	but	in	case	of	necessity	anyone	who	has	the	use	of	reason	may baptize. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>Q.	634.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"ordinary	minister"	of	a	Sacrament?	A.	By	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"ordinary	minister"	of	a	Sacrament	we	mean	the	one	who	usually	does administer	the	Sacrament,	and	who	has	always	the	right	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	635.	Can	a	person	who	has	not	himself	been	baptized,	and	who	does	not	even believe	in	the	Sacrament	of	baptism,	give	it	validly	to	another	in	case	of necessity?	A.	A	person	who	has	not	himself	been	baptized,	and	who	does	not even	believe	in	the	Sacrament	of	baptism,	can	give	it	validly	to	another	in	case of	necessity,	provided:	(1)	He	has	the	use	of	reason;	(2)	Knows	how	to	give baptism,	and	(3)	Intends	to	do	what	the	Church	intends	in	the	giving	of	the Sacrament.	Baptism	is	so	necessary	that	God	affords	every	opportunity	for	its reception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	636.	Why	do	the	consequences	of	original	sin,	such	as	suffering,	temptation, sickness,	and	death,	remain	after	the	sin	has	been	forgiven	in	baptism?	A.	The consequences	of	original	sin,	such	as	suffering,	temptation,	sickness	and	death, remain	after	the	sin	has	been	forgiven	in	baptism:	(1)	To	remind	us	of	the	misery that	always	follows	sin;	and	(2)	To	afford	us	an	opportunity	of	increasing	our merit	by	bearing	these	hardships	patiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	637.	Can	a	person	ever	receive	any	of	the	other	Sacraments	without	first receiving	baptism?	A.	A	person	can	never	receive	any	of	the	other	Sacraments without	first	receiving	baptism,	because	baptism	makes	us	members	of	Christ's Church,	and	unless	we	are	members	of	His	Church	we	cannot	receive	His Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	638.	{156}	How	is	Baptism	given?	A.	Whoever	baptizes	should	pour	water on	the	head	of	the	person	to	be	baptized,	and	say,	while	pouring	the	water:	"I baptize	thee	in	the	name	of	the	Father,	and	of	the	Son,	and	of	the	Holy	Ghost." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	639.	If	water	cannot	be	had,	in	case	of	necessity,	may	any	other liquid	be	used	for	baptism? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	If	water	cannot	be	had,	in	case	of	necessity	or	in	any	case,	no	other liquid	can	be	used,	and	the	baptism	cannot	be	given. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	640.	If	it	is	impossible,	in	case	of	necessity,	to	reach	the	head,	may	the	water be	poured	on	any	other	part	of	the	body?	A.	If	it	is	impossible,	in	case	of necessity,	to	reach	the	head,	the	water	should	be	poured	on	whatever	part	of	the body	can	be	reached;	but	then	the	baptism	must	be	given	conditionally;	that	is, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>before	pronouncing	the	words	of	baptism,	you	must	say:	"If	I	can	baptize	thee	in this	way,	I	baptize	thee	in	the	name	of	the	Father,"	&amp;c.	If	the	head	can	afterward be	reached,	the	water	must	be	poured	on	the	head	and	the	baptism	repeated conditionally	by	saying:	"If	you	are	not	already	baptized,	I	baptize	thee	in	the name,"	&amp;c. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	641.	Is	the	baptism	valid	if	we	say:	"I	baptize	thee	in	the	name	of	the	Holy Trinity,"	without	naming	the	Persons	of	the	Trinity?	A.	The	baptism	is	not	valid if	we	say:	"I	baptize	thee	in	the	name	of	the	Holy	Trinity,"	without	naming	the Persons	of	the	Trinity;	for	we	must	use	the	exact	words	instituted	by	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	642.	Is	it	wrong	to	defer	the	baptism	of	an	infant?	A.	It	is	wrong	to	defer	the baptism	of	an	infant,	because	we	thereby	expose	the	child	to	the	danger	of	dying without	the	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	643.	Can	we	baptize	a	child	against	the	wishes	of	its	parents?	A.	We	cannot baptize	a	child	against	the	wishes	of	its	parents;	and	if	the	parents	are	not Catholics,	they	must	not	only	consent	to	the	baptism,	but	also	agree	to	bring	the child	up	in	the	Catholic	religion.	But	if	a	child	is	surely	dying,	we	may	baptize	it without	either	the	consent	or	permission	of	its	parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	644.	{157}	How	many	kinds	of	Baptism	are	there?	A.	There	are	three	kinds of	Baptism:	Baptism	of	water,	of	desire,	and	of	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	645.	{158}	What	is	Baptism	of	water?	A.	Baptism	of	water	is	that	which	is given	by	pouring	water	on	the	head	of	the	person	to	be	baptized,	and	saying	at the	same	time,	"I	baptize	thee	in	the	name	of	the	Father,	and	of	the	Son,	and	of the	Holy	Ghost." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	646.	In	how	many	ways	was	the	baptism	of	water	given	in	the	first	ages	of	the Church?	A.	In	the	first	ages	of	the	Church,	baptism	of	water	was	given	in	three ways,	namely,	by	immersion	or	dipping,	by	aspersion	or	sprinkling,	and	by infusion	or	pouring.	Although	any	of	these	methods	would	be	valid,	only	the method	of	infusion	or	pouring	is	now	allowed	in	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	647.	What	are	the	chief	ceremonies	used	in	solemn	baptism,	and	what	do	they signify?	A.	The	chief	ceremonies	used	in	solemn	baptism	are:	(1)	A	profession of	faith	and	renouncement	of	the	devil	to	signify	our	worthiness;	(2)	The	placing of	salt	in	the	mouth	to	signify	the	wisdom	imparted	by	faith;	(3)	The	holding	of the	priest's	stole	to	signify	our	reception	into	the	Church;	(4)	The	anointing	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>signify	the	strength	given	by	the	Sacrament;	(5)	The	giving	of	the	white	garment or	cloth	to	signify	our	sinless	state	after	baptism;	and	(6)	The	giving	of	the lighted	candle	to	signify	the	light	of	faith	and	fire	of	love	that	should	dwell	in our	souls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	648.	Should	one	who,	in	case	of	necessity,	has	been	baptized	with	private baptism,	be	afterwards	brought	to	the	Church	to	have	the	ceremonies	of	solemn baptism	completed?	A.	One	who,	in	case	of	necessity,	has	been	baptized	with private	baptism	should	afterwards	be	brought	to	the	Church	to	have	the ceremonies	of	solemn	baptism	completed,	because	these	ceremonies	are commanded	by	the	Church	and	bring	down	blessings	upon	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	649.	Is	solemn	baptism	given	with	any	special	kind	of	water?	A.	Solemn baptism	is	given	with	consecrated	water;	that	is,	water	mixed	with	holy	oil	and blessed	for	baptism	on	Holy	Saturday	and	on	the	Saturday	before	Pentecost.	It	is always	kept	in	the	baptismal	font	in	the	baptistry—a	place	near	the	door	of	the Church	set	apart	for	baptism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	650.	{159}	What	is	Baptism	of	desire?	A.	Baptism	of	desire	is	an	ardent	wish to	receive	Baptism,	and	to	do	all	that	God	has	ordained	for	our	salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	651.	{160}	What	is	Baptism	of	blood? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Baptism	of	blood	is	the	shedding	of	one's	blood	for	the	faith	of Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	652.	What	is	the	baptism	of	blood	most	commonly	called?	A.	The	baptism	of blood	is	most	commonly	called	martyrdom,	and	those	who	receive	it	are	called martyrs.	It	is	the	death	one	patiently	suffers	from	the	enemies	of	our	religion, rather	than	give	up	Catholic	faith	or	virtue.	We	must	not	seek	martyrdom,	though we	must	endure	it	when	it	comes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	653.	{161}	Is	Baptism	of	desire	or	of	blood	sufficient	to	produce	the	effects of	Baptism	of	water?	A.	Baptism	of	desire	or	of	blood	is	sufficient	to	produce the	effects	of	the	Baptism	of	water,	if	it	is	impossible	to	receive	the	Baptism	of water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	654.	How	do	we	know	that	the	baptism	of	desire	or	of	blood	will	save	us when	it	is	impossible	to	receive	the	baptism	of	water?	A.	We	know	that	baptism of	desire	or	of	blood	will	save	us	when	it	is	impossible	to	receive	the	baptism	of water,	from	Holy	Scripture,	which	teaches	that	love	of	God	and	perfect</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>contrition	can	secure	the	remission	of	sins;	and	also	that	Our	Lord	promises salvation	to	those	who	lay	down	their	life	for	His	sake	or	for	His	teaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	655.	{162}	What	do	we	promise	in	Baptism?	A.	In	Baptism	we	promise	to renounce	the	devil,	with	all	his	works	and	pomps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	656.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"pomps"	of	the	devil?	A.	By	the	pomps	of	the devil	we	mean	all	worldly	pride,	vanities	and	vain	shows	by	which	people	are enticed	into	sin,	and	all	foolish	or	sinful	display	of	ourselves	or	of	what	we possess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	657.	{163}	Why	is	the	name	of	a	saint	given	in	Baptism?	A.	The	name	of	a saint	is	given	in	Baptism	in	order	that	the	person	baptized	may	imitate	his	virtues and	have	him	for	a	protector. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	658.	What	is	the	Saint	whose	name	we	bear	called?	A.	The	saint	whose	name we	bear	is	called	our	patron	saint—to	whom	we	should	have	great	devotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	659.	What	names	should	never	be	given	in	baptism?	A.	These	and	similar names	should	never	be	given	in	baptism:	(1)	The	names	of	noted	unbelievers, heretics	or	enemies	of	religion	and	virtue;	(2)	the	names	of	heathen	gods,	and	(3) nick-names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	660.	{164}	Why	are	godfathers	and	godmothers	given	in	Baptism?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Godfathers	and	godmothers	are	given	in	Baptism	in	order	that	they	may	promise, in	the	name	of	the	child,	what	the	child	itself	would	promise	if	it	had	the	use	of reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	661.	By	what	other	name	are	godfathers	and	godmothers	called?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Godfathers	and	godmothers	are	usually	called	sponsors.	Sponsors	are	not necessary	at	private	baptism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	662.	Can	a	person	ever	be	sponsor	when	absent	from	the	baptism?	A.	A person	can	be	sponsor	even	when	absent	from	the	baptism,	provided	he	has	been asked	and	has	consented	to	be	sponsor,	and	provided	also	some	one	answers	the questions	and	touches	the	person	to	be	baptized	in	his	name.	The	absent godfather	or	godmother	is	then	said	to	be	sponsor	by	proxy	and	becomes	the	real godparent	of	the	one	baptized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	663.	With	whom	do	godparents,	as	well	as	the	one	baptizing,	contract	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>relationship?	A.	Godparents,	as	well	as	the	one	baptizing,	contract	a	spiritual relationship	with	the	person	baptized	(not	with	his	parents),	and	this	relationship is	an	impediment	to	marriage	that	must	be	made	known	to	the	priest	in	case	of their	future	marriage	with	one	another.	The	godfather	and	godmother	contract	no relationship	with	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	664.	What	questions	should	persons	who	bring	a	child	for	baptism	be	able	to answer?	A.	Persons	who	bring	a	child	for	baptism	should	be	able	to	tell:	(1)	The exact	place	where	the	child	lives;	(2)	The	full	name	of	its	parents,	and,	in particular,	the	maiden	name,	or	name	before	her	marriage,	of	its	mother;	(3)	The exact	day	of	the	month	on	which	it	was	born;	(4)	Whether	or	not	it	has	received private	baptism,	and	(5)	Whether	its	parents	be	Catholics.	Sponsors	must	know also	the	chief	truths	of	our	religion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	665.	{165}	What	is	the	obligation	of	a	godfather	and	a	godmother?	A.	The obligation	of	a	godfather	and	a	godmother	is	to	instruct	the	child	in	its	religious duties,	if	the	parents	neglect	to	do	so	or	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	666.	Can	persons	who	are	not	Catholics	be	sponsors	for	Catholic	children?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Persons	who	are	not	Catholics	cannot	be	sponsors	for	Catholic	children,	because they	cannot	perform	the	duties	of	sponsors;	for	if	they	do	not	know	and	profess the	Catholic	religion	themselves,	how	can	they	teach	it	to	their	godchildren? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	they	must	answer	the	questions	asked	at	baptism	and	declare	that	they believe	in	the	Holy	Catholic	Church	and	in	all	it	teaches;	which	would	be	a falsehood	on	their	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	667.	What	should	parents	chiefly	consider	in	the	selection	of	sponsors	for their	children?	A.	In	the	selection	of	sponsors	for	their	children	parents	should chiefly	consider	the	good	character	and	virtue	of	the	sponsors,	selecting	model Catholics	to	whom	they	would	be	willing	at	the	hour	of	death	to	entrust	the	care and	training	of	their	children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	668.	What	dispositions	must	adults	or	grown	persons,	have	that	they	may worthily	receive	baptism?	A.	That	adults	may	worthily	receive	baptism:	(1)	They must	be	willing	to	receive	it;	(2)	they	must	have	faith	in	Christ;	(3)	they	must have	true	sorrow	for	their	sins,	and	(4)	they	must	solemnly	renounce	the	devil and	all	his	works;	that	is,	all	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	669.	What	is	the	ceremony	of	churching?	A.	The	ceremony	of	churching	is	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>particular	blessing	which	a	mother	receives	at	the	Altar,	as	soon	as	she	is	able	to present	herself	in	the	Church	after	the	birth	of	her	child.	In	this	ceremony	the priest	invokes	God's	blessing	on	the	mother	and	child,	while	she	on	her	part returns	thanks	to	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	FIFTEENTH.	ON	CONFIRMATION. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	670.	{166}	What	is	Confirmation?	A.	Confirmation	is	a	Sacrament	through which	we	receive	the	Holy	Ghost	to	make	us	strong	and	perfect	Christians	and soldiers	of	Jesus	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	671.	When	was	Confirmation	instituted?	A.	The	exact	time	at	which Confirmation	was	instituted	is	not	known.	But	as	this	Sacrament	was administered	by	the	Apostles	and	numbered	with	the	other	Sacraments	instituted by	Our	Lord,	it	is	certain	that	He	instituted	this	Sacrament	also	and	instructed His	Apostles	in	its	use,	at	some	time	before	His	ascension	into	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	672.	Why	is	Confirmation	so	called?	A.	Confirmation	is	so	called	from	its chief	effect,	which	is	to	strengthen	or	render	us	more	firm	in	whatever	belongs	to our	faith	and	religious	duties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	673.	Why	are	we	called	soldiers	of	Jesus	Christ?	A.	We	are	called	soldiers	of Jesus	Christ	to	indicate	how	we	must	resist	the	attacks	of	our	spiritual	enemies and	secure	our	victory	over	them	by	following	and	obeying	Our	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	674.	May	one	add	a	new	name	to	his	own	at	Confirmation?	A.	One	may	and should	add	a	new	name	to	his	own	at	Confirmation,	especially	when	the	name	of a	saint	has	not	been	given	in	Baptism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	675.	{167}	Who	administers	Confirmation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	bishop	is	the	ordinary	minister	of	Confirmation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	676.	Why	do	we	say	the	bishop	is	the	"ordinary	minister"	of	Confirmation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	say	the	bishop	is	the	ordinary	minister	of	Confirmation	because	in	some foreign	missions,	where	bishops	have	not	yet	been	appointed,	the	Holy	Father permits	one	of	the	priests	to	administer	Confirmation	with	the	Holy	Oil	blessed by	the	bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>Q.	677.	{168}	How	does	the	bishop	give	Confirmation?	A.	The	bishop	extends his	hands	over	those	who	are	to	be	confirmed,	prays	that	they	may	receive	the Holy	Ghost,	and	anoints	the	forehead	of	each	with	holy	chrism	in	the	form	of	a cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	678.	In	Confirmation,	what	does	the	extending	of	the	bishop's	hands	over	us signify?	A.	In	Confirmation,	the	extending	of	the	bishop's	hands	over	us	signifies the	descent	of	the	Holy	Ghost	upon	us	and	the	special	protection	of	God	through the	grace	of	Confirmation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	679.	{169}	What	is	holy	chrism?	A.	Holy	chrism	is	a	mixture	of	olive-oil	and balm,	consecrated	by	the	bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	680.	What	do	the	oil	and	balm	in	Holy	Chrism	signify?	A.	In	Holy	Chrism, the	oil	signifies	strength,	and	the	balm	signifies	the	freedom	from	corruption	and the	sweetness	which	virtue	must	give	to	our	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	681.	How	many	holy	oils	are	used	in	the	Church?	A.	Three	holy	oils	are	used in	the	Church,	namely,	the	oil	of	the	sick,	the	oil	of	catechumens,	and	holy chrism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	682.	What	constitutes	the	difference	between	these	oils?	A.	The	form	of prayer	or	blessing	alone	constitutes	the	difference	between	these	oils;	for	they are	all	olive	oil,	but	in	the	Holy	Chrism,	balm	is	mixed	with	the	oil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	683.	When	and	by	whom	are	the	holy	oils	blessed?	A.	The	holy	oils	are blessed	at	the	Mass	on	Holy	Thursday	by	the	bishop,	who	alone	has	the	right	to bless	them.	After	the	blessing	they	are	distributed	to	the	priests	of	the	diocese, who	must	then	burn	what	remains	of	the	old	oils	and	use	the	newly	blessed	oils for	the	coming	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	684.	For	what	are	the	holy	oils	used?	A.	The	holy	oils	are	used	as	follows: The	oil	of	the	sick	is	used	for	Extreme	Unction	and	for	some	blessings;	the	oil	of catechumens	is	used	for	Baptism	and	Holy	Orders.	Holy	Chrism	is	used	at Baptism	and	for	the	blessing	of	some	sacred	things,	such	as	altars,	chalices, church-bells,	&amp;c.,	which	are	usually	blessed	by	a	bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">{T.N.:	The	above	answer	omits	that	Holy	Chrism	is	used	also	at Confirmation.	See	Q.	677.}</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>Q.	685.	{170}	What	does	the	bishop	say	in	anointing	the	person	he	confirms?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	anointing	the	person	he	confirms	the	bishop	says:	"I	sign	thee	with	the	sign	of the	cross,	and	I	confirm	thee	with	the	chrism	of	salvation,	in	the	name	of	the Father,	and	of	the	Son,	and	of	the	Holy	Ghost." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	686.	{171}	What	is	meant	by	anointing	the	forehead	with	chrism	in	the	form of	a	cross?	A.	By	anointing	the	forehead	with	chrism	in	the	form	of	a	cross	is meant	that	the	Christian	who	is	confirmed	must	openly	profess	and	practice	his faith,	never	be	ashamed	of	it;	and	rather	die	than	deny	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	687.	When	must	we	openly	profess	and	practice	our	religion?	A.	We	must openly	profess	and	practice	our	religion	as	often	as	we	cannot	do	otherwise without	violating	some	law	of	God	or	of	His	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	688.	Why	have	we	good	reason	never	to	be	ashamed	of	the	Catholic	faith?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	good	reason	never	to	be	ashamed	of	the	Catholic	Faith	because	it	is	the Old	Faith	established	by	Christ	and	taught	by	His	Apostles;	it	is	the	Faith	for which	countless	Holy	Martyrs	suffered	and	died;	it	is	the	Faith	that	has	brought true	civilization,	with	all	its	benefits,	into	the	world,	and	it	is	the	only	Faith	that can	truly	reform	and	preserve	public	and	private	morals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	689.	{172}	Why	does	the	bishop	give	the	person	he	confirms	a	slight	blow	on the	cheek?	A.	The	bishop	gives	the	person	he	confirms	a	slight	blow	on	the cheek,	to	put	him	in	mind	that	he	must	be	ready	to	suffer	everything,	even	death, for	the	sake	of	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	690.	Is	it	right	to	test	ourselves	through	our	imagination	of	what	we	would	be willing	to	suffer	for	the	sake	of	Christ?	A.	It	is	not	right	to	test	ourselves	through our	imagination	of	what	we	would	be	willing	to	suffer	for	the	sake	of	Christ,	for such	tests	may	lead	us	into	sin.	When	a	real	test	comes	we	are	assured	God	will give	to	us,	as	He	did	to	the	Holy	Martyrs,	sufficient	grace	to	endure	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	691.	{173}	To	receive	Confirmation	worthily	is	it	necessary	to	be	in the	state	of	grace? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	To	receive	Confirmation	worthily	it	is	necessary	to	be	in	the	state of	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	692.	{174}	What	special	preparation	should	be	made	to	receive Confirmation?	A.	Persons	of	an	age	to	learn	should	know	the	chief	mysteries	of faith	and	the	duties	of	a	Christian,	and	be	instructed	in	the	nature	and	effects	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>this	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	693.	Why	should	we	know	the	chief	mysteries	of	faith	and	the	duties	of	a Christian	before	receiving	Confirmation?	A.	We	should	know	the	Chief Mysteries	of	Faith	and	the	duties	of	a	Christian	before	receiving	Confirmation because	as	one	cannot	be	a	good	soldier	without	knowing	the	rules	of	the	army to	which	he	belongs	and	understanding	the	commands	of	his	leader,	so	one cannot	be	a	good	Christian	without	knowing	the	laws	of	the	Church	and understanding	the	commands	of	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	694.	{175}	Is	it	a	sin	to	neglect	Confirmation?	A.	It	is	a	sin	to	neglect Confirmation,	especially	in	these	evil	days	when	faith	and	morals	are	exposed	to so	many	and	such	violent	temptations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	695.	What	do	we	mean	by	"these	evil	days"?	A.	By	"these	evil	days"	we mean	the	present	age	or	century	in	which	we	are	living,	surrounded	on	all	sides by	unbelief,	false	doctrines,	bad	books,	bad	example	and	temptation	in	every form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	696.	Is	Confirmation	necessary	for	salvation?	A.	Confirmation	is	not	so necessary	for	salvation	that	we	could	not	be	saved	without	it,	for	it	is	not	given to	infants	even	in	danger	of	death;	nevertheless,	there	is	a	divine	command obliging	all	to	receive	it,	if	possible.	Persons	who	have	not	been	confirmed	in youth	should	make	every	effort	to	be	confirmed	later	in	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	697.	Are	sponsors	necessary	in	Confirmation?	A.	Sponsors	are	necessary	in Confirmation,	and	they	must	be	of	the	same	good	character	as	those	required	at Baptism,	for	they	take	upon	themselves	the	same	duties	and	responsibilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	also	contract	a	spiritual	relationship,	which,	however,	unlike	that	in Baptism,	is	not	an	impediment	to	marriage. </p>

It	is	clear	that	the	devil	could	easily	deceive	us	if	the	Holy Ghost	did	not	aid	us,	for	just	as	our	sins	do	not	deprive	us	of	our	knowledge,	so the	devil's	sin	did	not	deprive	him	of	the	great	intelligence	and	power	which	he possessed	as	an	angel.	Moreover,	his	experience	in	the	world	extends	over	all ages	and	places,	while	ours	is	confined	to	a	few	years	and	to	a	limited	number	of places. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>Q.	706.	{183}	Why	do	we	receive	the	gift	of	Understanding?	A.	We	receive	the gift	of	Understanding	to	enable	us	to	know	more	clearly	the	mysteries	of	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	707.	{184}	Why	do	we	receive	the	gift	of	Wisdom? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	receive	the	gift	of	Wisdom	to	give	us	a	relish	for	the	things	of God,	and	to	direct	our	whole	life	and	all	our	actions	to	His	honor	and glory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	708.	{185}	Which	are	the	Beatitudes? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Beatitudes	are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1.	Blessed	are	the	poor	in	spirit,	for	theirs	is	the	kingdom	of	heaven.	2.	Blessed are	the	meek,	for	they	shall	possess	the	land.	3.	Blessed	are	they	that	mourn,	for they	shall	be	comforted.	4.	Blessed	are	they	that	hunger	and	thirst	after	justice, for	they	shall	be	filled.	5.	Blessed	are	the	merciful,	for	they	shall	obtain	mercy.	6. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blessed	are	the	clean	of	heart,	for	they	shall	see	God.	7.	Blessed	are	the peacemakers,	for	they	shall	be	called	the	children	of	God.	8.	Blessed	are	they that	suffer	persecution	for	justice'	sake,	for	theirs	is	the	kingdom	of	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	709.	What	are	the	Beatitudes	and	why	are	they	so	called?	A.	The	Beatitudes are	a	portion	of	Our	Lord's	Sermon	on	the	Mount,	and	they	are	so	called	because each	of	them	holds	out	a	promised	reward	to	those	who	practice	the	virtues	they recommend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	710.	Where	did	Our	Lord	usually	preach?	A.	Our	Lord	usually	preached wherever	an	opportunity	of	doing	good	by	His	Words	presented	itself.	He preached	at	times	in	the	synagogues	or	meeting-houses	but	more	frequently	in the	open	air—by	the	seashore	or	on	the	mountain,	and	often	by	the	wayside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	711.	What	is	the	meaning	and	use	of	the	Beatitudes	in	general?	A.	(1)	In general	the	Beatitudes	embrace	whatever	pertains	to	the	perfection	of	Christian life,	and	they	invite	us	to	the	practice	of	the	highest	Christian	virtues;	(2)	In different	forms	they	all	promise	the	same	reward,	namely,	sanctifying	grace	in this	life	and	eternal	glory	in	the	next;	(3)	They	offer	us	encouragement	and consolation	for	every	trial	and	affliction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	712.	What	does	the	first	Beatitude	mean	by	the	"poor	in	spirit"?	A.	The	first Beatitude	means	by	the	"poor	in	spirit"	all	persons,	rich	or	poor,	who	would	not offend	God	to	possess	or	retain	anything	that	this	world	can	give;	and	who,	when necessity	or	charity	requires	it,	give	willingly	for	the	glory	of	God.	It	includes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>also	those	who	humbly	submit	to	their	condition	in	life	when	it	cannot	be improved	by	lawful	means. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	713.	Who	are	the	mourners	who	deserve	the	consolation	promised	in	the	third Beatitude?	A.	The	mourners	who	deserve	the	consolation	promised	in	the	third Beatitude	are	they	who,	out	of	love	for	God,	bewail	their	own	sins	and	those	of the	world;	and	they	who	patiently	endure	all	trials	that	come	from	God	or	for	His sake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	714.	What	lessons	do	the	other	Beatitudes	convey?	A.	The	other	Beatitudes convey	these	lessons:	The	meek	suppress	all	feelings	of	anger	and	humbly submit	to	whatever	befalls	them	by	the	Will	of	God;	and	they	never	desire	to	do evil	for	evil.	The	justice	after	which	we	should	seek	is	every	Christian	virtue included	under	that	name,	and	we	are	told	that	if	we	earnestly	desire	and	seek	it we	shall	obtain	it.	The	persecuted	for	justice'	sake	are	they	who	will	not	abandon their	faith	or	virtue	for	any	cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	715.	Who	may	be	rightly	called	merciful?	A.	The	merciful	are	they	who practice	the	corporal	and	spiritual	works	of	mercy,	and	who	aid	by	word	or	deed those	who	need	their	help	for	soul	or	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	716.	Why	are	the	clean	of	heart	promised	so	great	a	reward?	A.	The	clean	of heart,	that	is,	the	truly	virtuous,	whose	thoughts,	desires,	words	and	works	are pure	and	modest,	are	promised	so	great	a	reward	because	the	chaste	and	sinless have	always	been	the	most	intimate	friends	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	717.	What	is	the	duty	of	a	peacemaker?	A.	It	is	the	duty	of	a	peacemaker	to avoid	and	prevent	quarrels,	reconcile	enemies,	and	to	put	an	end	to	all	evil reports	of	others	or	evil	speaking	against	them.	As	peacemakers	are	called	the children	of	God,	disturbers	of	peace	should	be	called	the	children	of	the	devil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	718.	Why	does	Our	Lord	speak	in	particular	of	poverty,	meekness,	sorrow, desire	for	virtue,	mercy,	purity,	peace	and	suffering?	A.	Our	Lord	speaks	in particular	of	poverty,	meekness,	sorrow,	desire	for	virtue,	mercy,	purity,	peace and	suffering	because	these	are	the	chief	features	in	His	own	earthly	life;	poverty in	His	birth,	life	and	death;	meekness	in	His	teaching;	sorrow	at	all	times.	He eagerly	sought	to	do	good,	showed	mercy	to	all,	recommended	chastity,	brought peace,	and	patiently	endured	suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	719.	{186}	Which	are	the	twelve	fruits	of	the	Holy	Ghost? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	720.	Why	are	charity,	joy,	peace,	&amp;c.,	called	fruits	of	the	Holy Ghost? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Charity,	joy,	peace,	&amp;c.,	are	called	fruits	of	the	Holy	Ghost	because they	grow	in	our	souls	out	of	the	seven	gifts	of	the	Holy	Ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	SEVENTEENTH.	ON	THE	SACRAMENT	OF</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PENANCE. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	721.	{187}	What	is	the	Sacrament	of	Penance?	A.	Penance	is	a	Sacrament	in which	the	sins	committed	after	Baptism	are	forgiven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	722.	Has	the	word	Penance	any	other	meaning?	A.	The	word	Penance	has other	meanings.	It	means	also	those	punishments	we	inflict	upon	ourselves	as	a means	of	atoning	for	our	past	sins;	it	means	likewise	that	disposition	of	the	heart in	which	we	detest	and	bewail	our	sins	because	they	were	offensive	to	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	723.	How	does	the	institution	of	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	show	the goodness	of	Our	Lord? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	institution	of	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	shows	the	goodness	of	Our Lord,	because	having	once	saved	us	through	Baptism,	He	might	have	left us	to	perish	if	we	again	committed	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	724.	What	are	the	natural	benefits	of	the	Sacrament	of	Penance?	A.	The natural	benefits	of	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	are:	It	gives	us	in	our	confessor	a true	friend,	to	whom	we	can	go	in	all	our	trials	and	to	whom	we	can	confide	our secrets	with	the	hope	of	obtaining	advice	and	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	725.	{188}	How	does	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	remit	sin,	and	restore to	the	soul	the	friendship	of	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Sacrament	of	Penance	remits	sin	and	restores	the	friendship	of God	to	the	soul	by	means	of	the	absolution	of	the	priest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>Q.	726.	What	is	Absolution?	A.	Absolution	is	the	form	of	prayer	or	words	the priest	pronounces	over	us	with	uplifted	hand	when	he	forgives	the	sins	we	have confessed.	It	is	given	while	we	are	saying	the	Act	of	Contrition	after	receiving our	Penance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	727.	Does	the	priest	ever	refuse	absolution	to	a	penitent?	A.	The	priest	must and	does	refuse	absolution	to	a	penitent	when	he	thinks	the	penitent	is	not	rightly disposed	for	the	Sacrament.	He	sometimes	postpones	the	absolution	till	the	next confession,	either	for	the	good	of	the	penitent	or	for	the	sake	of	better preparation—especially	when	the	person	has	been	a	long	time	from	confession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	728.	What	should	a	person	do	when	the	priest	has	refused	or	postponed absolution?	A.	When	the	priest	has	refused	or	postponed	absolution,	the	penitent should	humbly	submit	to	his	decision,	follow	his	instructions,	and	endeavor	to remove	whatever	prevented	the	giving	of	the	absolution	and	return	to	the	same confessor	with	the	necessary	dispositions	and	resolution	of	amendment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	729.	Can	the	priest	forgive	all	sins	in	the	Sacrament	of	Penance?	A.	The priest	has	the	power	to	forgive	all	sins	in	the	Sacrament	of	Penance,	but	he	may not	have	the	authority	to	forgive	all.	To	forgive	sins	validly	in	the	Sacrament	of Penance,	two	things	are	required:	(1)	The	power	to	forgive	sins	which	every priest	receives	at	his	ordination,	and	(2)	the	right	to	use	that	power	which	must be	given	by	the	bishop,	who	authorizes	the	priest	to	hear	confessions	and	pass judgment	on	the	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	730.	What	are	the	sins	called	which	the	priest	has	no	authority	to	absolve?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sins	which	the	priest	has	no	authority	to	absolve	are	called	reserved	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Absolution	from	these	sins	can	be	obtained	only	from	the	bishop,	and	sometimes only	from	the	Pope,	or	by	his	special	permission.	Persons	having	a	reserved	sin to	confess	cannot	be	absolved	from	any	of	their	sins	till	the	priest	receives faculties	or	authority	to	absolve	the	reserved	sin	also. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	731.	Why	is	the	absolution	from	some	sins	reserved	to	the	Pope	or	bishop?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	absolution	from	some	sins	is	reserved	to	the	Pope	or	bishop	to	deter	or prevent,	by	this	special	restriction,	persons	from	committing	them,	either	on account	of	the	greatness	of	the	sin	itself	or	on	account	of	its	evil	consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	732.	Can	any	priest	absolve	a	person	in	danger	of	death	from	reserved	sins without	the	permission	of	the	bishop?	A.	Any	priest	can	absolve	a	person	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>danger	of	death	from	reserved	sins	without	the	permission	of	the	bishop,	because at	the	hour	of	death	the	Church	removes	these	restrictions	in	order	to	save,	if possible,	the	soul	of	the	dying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	733.	{189}	How	do	you	know	that	the	priest	has	the	power	of	absolving	from the	sins	committed	after	Baptism?	A.	I	know	that	the	priest	has	the	power	of absolving	from	the	sins	committed	after	Baptism,	because	Jesus	Christ	granted that	power	to	the	priests	of	His	Church	when	He	said:	"Receive	ye	the	Holy Ghost.	Whose	sins	you	shall	forgive,	they	are	forgiven	them;	whose	sins	you shall	retain,	they	are	retained." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	734.	How	do	we	know	that	Our	Lord,	while	on	earth,	had	the	power	to forgive	sins?	A.	We	know	that	Our	Lord,	while	on	earth,	had	the	power	to forgive	sins:	(1)	because	He	was	always	God,	and;	(2)	because	He	frequently	did forgive	sins	and	proved	their	forgiveness	by	miracles.	Since	He	had	the	power Himself,	He	could	give	it	to	His	Apostles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	735.	Was	the	power	to	forgive	sins	given	to	the	apostles	alone?	A.	The	power to	forgive	sins	was	not	given	to	the	apostles	alone,	because	it	was	not	given	for the	benefit	merely	of	those	who	lived	at	the	time	of	the	apostles,	but	for	all	who, having	grievously	sinned,	after	Baptism,	should	need	forgiveness.	Since, therefore,	Baptism	will	be	given	till	the	end	of	time,	and	since	the	danger	of sinning	after	it	always	remains	the	power	to	absolve	from	such	sins	must	also remain	in	the	Church	till	the	end	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	736.	When	was	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	instituted? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Sacrament	of	Penance	was	instituted	after	the	resurrection	of	Our Lord,	when	He	gave	to	His	apostles	the	power	to	forgive	sins,	which	He had	promised	to	them	before	His	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	737.	Are	the	enemies	of	our	religion	right	when	they	say	man	cannot	forgive sins?	A.	The	enemies	of	our	religion	are	right	when	they	say	man	cannot	forgive sins	if	they	mean	that	he	cannot	forgive	them	by	his	own	power,	but	they	are certainly	wrong	if	they	mean	that	he	cannot	forgive	them	even	by	the	power	of God,	for	man	can	do	anything	if	God	gives	him	the	power.	The	priest	does	not forgive	sins	by	his	own	power	as	man,	but	by	the	authority	he	receives	as	the minister	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	738.	{190}	How	do	the	priests	of	the	Church	exercise	the	power	of	forgiving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>sins?	A.	The	priests	of	the	Church	exercise	the	power	of	forgiving	sins	by hearing	the	confession	of	sins,	and	granting	pardon	for	them	as	ministers	of	God and	in	His	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	739.	How	does	the	power	to	forgive	sins	imply	the	obligation	of	going	to confession?	A.	The	power	to	forgive	sins	implies	the	obligation	of	going	to confession	because	as	sins	are	usually	committed	secretly,	the	priest	could	never know	what	sins	to	forgive	and	what	not	to	forgive,	unless	the	sins	committed were	made	known	to	him	by	the	persons	guilty	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	740.	Could	God	not	forgive	our	sins	if	we	confessed	them	to	Himself	in secret?	A.	Certainly,	God	could	forgive	our	sins	if	we	confessed	them	to	Himself in	secret,	but	He	has	not	promised	to	do	so;	whereas	He	has	promised	to	pardon them	if	we	confess	them	to	His	priests.	Since	He	is	free	to	pardon	or	not	to pardon,	He	has	the	right	to	establish	a	Sacrament	through	which	alone	He	will pardon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	741.	{191}	What	must	we	do	to	receive	the	Sacrament	of	Penance worthily? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	To	receive	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	worthily	we	must	do	five	things: 1.	We	must	examine	our	conscience.	2.	We	must	have	sorrow	for	our	sins.	3.	We must	make	a	firm	resolution	never	more	to	offend	God.	4.	We	must	confess	our sins	to	the	priest.	5.	We	must	accept	the	penance	which	the	priest	gives	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	742.	What	should	we	pray	for	in	preparing	for	confession?	A.	In	preparing	for confession	we	should	pray	to	the	Holy	Ghost	to	give	us	light	to	know	our	sins and	to	understand	their	guilt;	for	grace	to	detest	them;	for	courage	to	confess them	and	for	strength	to	keep	our	resolutions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	743.	What	faults	do	many	commit	in	preparing	for	confession?	A.	In preparing	for	confession	many	commit	the	faults:	(1)	of	giving	too	much	time	to the	examination	of	conscience	and	little	or	none	in	exciting	themselves	to	true sorrow	for	the	sins	discovered;	(2)	of	trying	to	recall	every	trifling	circumstance, instead	of	thinking	of	the	means	by	which	they	will	avoid	their	sins	for	the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	744.	What,	then,	is	the	most	important	part	of	the	preparation	for	confession? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	most	important	part	of	the	preparation	for	confession	is	sincere	sorrow for	the	sins	committed	and	the	firm	determination	to	avoid	them	for	the	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>Q.	745.	What	is	the	chief	reason	that	our	confessions	do	not	always	amend	our way	of	living?	A.	The	chief	reason	that	our	confessions	do	not	always	amend	our way	of	living	is	our	want	of	real	earnest	preparation	for	them	and	the	fact	that	we have	not	truly	convinced	ourselves	of	the	need	of	amendment.	We	often	confess our	sins	more	from	habit,	necessity	or	fear	than	from	a	real	desire	of	receiving grace	and	of	being	restored	to	the	friendship	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	746.	What	faults	are	to	be	avoided	in	making	our	confession?	A.	In	making our	confession	we	are	to	avoid:	(1)	Telling	useless	details,	the	sins	of	others,	or the	name	of	any	person;	(2)	Confessing	sins	we	are	not	sure	of	having committed;	exaggerating	our	sins	or	their	number;	multiplying	the	number	of times	a	day	by	the	number	of	days	to	get	the	exact	number	of	habitual	sins;	(3) Giving	a	vague	answer,	such	as	"sometimes,"	when	asked	how	often;	waiting after	each	sin	to	be	asked	for	the	next;	(4)	Hesitating	over	sins	through	pretented modesty	and	thus	delaying	the	priests	and	others;	telling	the	exact	words	in	each when	we	have	committed	several	sins	of	the	same	kind,	cursing,	for	example; and,	lastly,	leaving	the	confessional	before	the	priest	gives	us	a	sign	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	747.	Is	it	wrong	to	go	to	confession	out	of	your	turn	against	the	will	of	others waiting	with	you?	A.	It	is	wrong	to	go	to	confession	out	of	our	turn	against	the will	of	others	waiting	with	us,	because	(1)	it	causes	disorder,	quarreling	and scandalous	conduct	in	the	Church;	(2)	it	is	unjust,	makes	others	angry	and lessens	their	good	dispositions	for	confession;	(3)	it	annoys	and	distracts	the priest	by	the	confusion	and	disorder	it	creates.	It	is	better	to	wait	than	go	to confession	in	an	excited	and	disorderly	manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	748.	What	should	a	penitent	do	who	knows	he	cannot	perform	the	penance given?	A.	A	penitent	who	knows	he	cannot	perform	the	penance	given	should ask	the	priest	for	one	that	he	can	perform.	When	we	forget	the	penance	given	we must	ask	for	it	again,	for	we	cannot	fulfill	our	duty	by	giving	ourselves	a penance.	The	penance	must	be	performed	at	the	time	and	in	the	manner	the confessor	directs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	749.	{192}	What	is	the	examination	of	conscience?	A.	The	examination	of conscience	is	an	earnest	effort	to	recall	to	mind	all	the	sins	we	have	committed since	our	last	worthy	confession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	750.	When	is	our	confession	worthy?	A.	Our	confession	is	worthy	when	we have	done	all	that	is	required	for	a	good	confession,	and	when,	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>absolution,	our	sins	are	really	forgiven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	751.	{193}	How	can	we	make	a	good	examination	of	conscience?	A.	We	can make	a	good	examination	of	conscience	by	calling	to	memory	the commandments	of	God,	the	precepts	of	the	Church,	the	seven	capital	sins,	and the	particular	duties	of	our	state	in	life,	to	find	out	the	sins	we	have	committed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	752.	{194}	What	should	we	do	before	beginning	the	examination	of conscience? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Before	beginning	the	examination	of	conscience	we	should	pray	to	God to	give	us	light	to	know	our	sins	and	grace	to	detest	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	EIGHTEENTH.	ON	CONTRITION. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	753.	{195}	What	is	contrition,	or	sorrow	for	sin?	A.	Contrition,	or	sorrow	for sin,	is	a	hatred	of	sin	and	a	true	grief	of	the	soul	for	having	offended	God,	with	a firm	purpose	of	sinning	no	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	754.	Give	an	example	of	how	we	should	hate	and	avoid	sin.	A.	We	should hate	and	avoid	sin	as	one	hates	and	avoids	a	poison	that	almost	caused	his	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	may	not	grieve	over	the	death	of	our	soul	as	we	do	over	the	death	of	a	friend, and	yet	our	sorrow	may	be	true;	because	the	sorrow	for	sin	comes	more	from	our reason	than	from	our	feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	755.	{196}	What	kind	of	sorrow	should	we	have	for	our	sins?	A.	The	sorrow we	should	have	for	our	sins	should	be	interior,	supernatural,	universal,	and sovereign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	756.	{197}	What	do	you	mean	by	saying	that	our	sorrow	should	be interior? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	When	I	say	that	our	sorrow	should	be	interior,	I	mean	that	it	should come	from	the	heart,	and	not	merely	from	the	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	757.	{198}	What	do	you	mean	by	saying	that	our	sorrow	should	be supernatural?	A.	When	I	say	that	our	sorrow	should	be	supernatural,	I	mean	that it	should	be	prompted	by	the	grace	of	God,	and	excited	by	motives	which	spring from	faith,	and	not	by	merely	natural	motives. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>Q.	758.	What	do	we	mean	by	"motives	that	spring	from	faith"	and	by	"merely natural	motives"	with	regard	to	sorrow	for	sin?	A.	By	sorrow	for	sin	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">"motives	that	spring	from	faith,"	we	mean	sorrow	for	reasons	that	God	has	made known	to	us,	such	as	the	loss	of	heaven,	the	fear	of	hell	or	purgatory,	or	the dread	of	afflictions	that	come	from	God	in	punishment	for	sin.	By	"merely natural	motives"	we	mean	sorrow	for	reasons	made	known	to	us	by	our	own experience	or	by	the	experience	of	others,	such	as	loss	of	character,	goods	or health.	A	motive	is	whatever	moves	our	will	to	do	or	avoid	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	759.	{199}	What	do	you	mean	by	saying	that	our	sorrow	should	be universal? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	When	I	say	that	our	sorrow	should	be	universal,	I	mean	that	we	should be	sorry	for	all	our	mortal	sins	without	exception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	760.	Why	cannot	some	of	our	mortal	sins	be	forgiven	while	the	rest	remain	on our	souls?	A.	It	is	impossible	for	any	of	our	mortal	sins	to	be	forgiven	unless they	are	all	forgiven,	because	as	light	and	darkness	cannot	be	together	in	the same	place,	so	sanctifying	grace	and	mortal	sin	cannot	dwell	together.	If	there	be grace	in	the	soul,	there	can	be	no	mortal	sin,	and	if	there	be	mortal	sin,	there	can be	no	grace,	for	one	mortal	sin	expels	all	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	761.	{200}	What	do	you	mean	when	you	say	that	our	sorrow	should	be sovereign?	A.	When	I	say	that	our	sorrow	should	be	sovereign,	I	mean	that	we should	grieve	more	for	having	offended	God	than	for	any	other	evil	that	can befall	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	762.	{201}	Why	should	we	be	sorry	for	our	sins?	A.	We	should	be	sorry	for our	sins	because	sin	is	the	greatest	of	evils	and	an	offense	against	God	our Creator,	Preserver,	and	Redeemer,	and	because	it	shuts	us	out	of	heaven	and condemns	us	to	the	eternal	pains	of	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	763.	How	do	we	show	that	sin	is	the	greatest	of	all	evils?	A.	We	show	that	sin is	the	greatest	of	evils	because	its	effects	last	the	longest	and	have	the	most terrible	consequences.	All	the	misfortunes	of	this	world	can	last	only	for	a	time, and	we	escape	them	at	death,	whereas	the	evils	caused	by	sin	keep	with	us	for	all eternity	and	are	only	increased	at	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	764.	{202}	How	many	kinds	of	contrition	are	there?	A.	There	are	two	kinds of	contrition;	perfect	contrition	and	imperfect	contrition. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>Q.	765.	{203}	What	is	perfect	contrition?	A.	Perfect	contrition	is	that	which	fills us	with	sorrow	and	hatred	for	sin,	because	it	offends	God,	who	is	infinitely	good in	Himself	and	worthy	of	all	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	766.	When	will	perfect	contrition	obtain	pardon	for	mortal	sin	without	the Sacrament	of	Penance?	A.	Perfect	contrition	will	obtain	pardon	for	mortal	sin without	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	when	we	cannot	go	to	confession,	but	with	the perfect	contrition	we	must	have	the	intention	of	going	to	confession	as	soon	as possible,	if	we	again	have	the	opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	767.	{204}	What	is	imperfect	contrition?	A.	Imperfect	contrition	is	that	by which	we	hate	what	offends	God	because	by	it	we	lose	heaven	and	deserve	hell; or	because	sin	is	so	hateful	in	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	768.	What	other	name	is	given	to	imperfect	contrition	and	why	is	it	called imperfect?	A.	Imperfect	contrition	is	called	attrition.	It	is	called	imperfect	only because	it	is	less	perfect	than	the	highest	grade	of	contrition	by	which	we	are sorry	for	sin	out	of	pure	love	of	God's	own	goodness	and	without	any consideration	of	what	befalls	ourselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	769.	{205}	Is	imperfect	contrition	sufficient	for	a	worthy confession? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Imperfect	contrition	is	sufficient	for	a	worthy	confession,	but	we should	endeavor	to	have	perfect	contrition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	770.	{206}	What	do	you	mean	by	a	firm	purpose	of	sinning	no	more?	A.	By	a firm	purpose	of	sinning	no	more	I	mean	a	fixed	resolve	not	only	to	avoid	all mortal	sin,	but	also	its	near	occasions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	771.	{207}	What	do	you	mean	by	the	near	occasions	of	sin?	A.	By	the	near occasions	of	sin	I	mean	all	the	persons,	places	and	things	that	may	easily	lead	us into	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	772.	Why	are	we	bound	to	avoid	occasions	of	sin?	A.	We	are	bound	to	avoid occasions	of	sin	because	Our	Lord	has	said:	"He	who	loves	the	danger	will perish	in	it";	and	as	we	are	bound	to	avoid	the	loss	of	our	souls,	so	we	are	bound to	avoid	the	danger	of	their	loss.	The	occasion	is	the	cause	of	sin,	and	you	cannot take	away	the	evil	without	removing	its	cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	773.	Is	a	person	who	is	determined	to	avoid	the	sin,	but	who	is	unwilling	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>give	up	its	near	occasion	when	it	is	possible	to	do	so,	rightly	disposed	for confession?	A.	A	person	who	is	determined	to	avoid	the	sin,	but	who	is unwilling	to	give	up	its	near	occasion	when	it	is	possible	to	do	so,	is	not	rightly disposed	for	confession,	and	he	will	not	be	absolved	if	he	makes	known	to	the priest	the	true	state	of	his	conscience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	774.	How	many	kinds	of	occasions	of	sin	are	there?	A.	There	are	four	kinds of	occasions	of	sin:	(1)	Near	occasions,	through	which	we	always	fall;	(2) remote	occasions,	through	which	we	sometimes	fall;	(3)	voluntary	occasions	or those	we	can	avoid;	and	(4)	involuntary	occasions	or	those	we	cannot	avoid.	A person	who	lives	in	a	near	and	voluntary	occasion	of	sin	need	not	expect forgiveness	while	he	continues	in	that	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	775.	What	persons,	places	and	things	are	usually	occasions	of	sin?	A.	(1)	The persons	who	are	occasions	of	sin	are	all	those	in	whose	company	we	sin, whether	they	be	bad	of	themselves	or	bad	only	while	in	our	company,	in	which case	we	also	become	occasions	of	sin	for	them;	(2)	the	places	are	usually	liquor saloons,	low	theaters,	indecent	dances,	entertainments,	amusements,	exhibitions, and	all	immoral	resorts	of	any	kind,	whether	we	sin	in	them	or	not;	(3)	the	things are	all	bad	books,	indecent	pictures,	songs,	jokes	and	the	like,	even	when	they are	tolerated	by	public	opinion	and	found	in	public	places. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	NINETEENTH.	ON	CONFESSION. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	776.	{208}	What	is	Confession?	A.	Confession	is	the	telling	of	our	sins	to	a duly	authorized	priest,	for	the	purpose	of	obtaining	forgiveness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	777.	Who	is	a	duly	authorized	priest?	A.	A	duly	authorized	priest	is	one	sent to	hear	confessions	by	the	lawful	bishop	of	the	diocese	in	which	we	are	at	the time	of	our	confession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	778.	Is	it	ever	allowed	to	write	our	sins	and	read	them	to	the	priest	in	the confessional	or	give	them	to	him	to	read?	A.	It	is	allowed,	when	necessary,	to write	our	sins	and	read	them	to	the	priest,	as	persons	do	who	have	almost entirely	lost	their	memory.	It	is	also	allowed	to	give	the	paper	to	the	priest,	as persons	do	who	have	lost	the	use	of	their	speech.	In	such	cases	the	paper	must, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>after	the	confession,	be	carefully	destroyed	either	by	the	priest	or	the	penitent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	779.	What	is	to	be	done	when	persons	must	make	their	confession	and	cannot find	a	priest	who	understands	their	language?	A.	Persons	who	must	make	their confession	and	who	cannot	find	a	priest	who	understands	their	language,	must confess	as	best	they	can	by	some	signs,	showing	what	sins	they	wish	to	confess and	how	they	are	sorry	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	780.	{209}	What	sins	are	we	bound	to	confess?	A.	We	are	bound	to	confess all	our	mortal	sins,	but	it	is	well	also	to	confess	our	venial	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	781.	Why	is	it	well	to	confess	also	the	venial	sins	we	remember?	A.	It	is	well to	confess	also	the	venial	sins	we	remember	(1)	because	it	shows	our	hatred	of all	sin,	and	(2)	because	it	is	sometimes	difficult	to	determine	just	when	a	sin	is venial	and	when	mortal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	782.	What	should	one	do	who	has	only	venial	sins	to	confess?	A.	One	who has	only	venial	sins	to	confess	should	tell	also	some	sin	already	confessed	in	his past	life	for	which	he	knows	he	is	truly	sorry;	because	it	is	not	easy	to	be	truly sorry	for	slight	sins	and	imperfections,	and	yet	we	must	be	sorry	for	the	sins confessed	that	our	confession	may	be	valid—hence	we	add	some	past	sin	for which	we	are	truly	sorry	to	those	for	which	we	may	not	be	sufficiently	sorry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	783.	Should	a	person	stay	from	confession	because	he	thinks	he	has	no	sin	to confess?	A.	A	person	should	not	stay	from	confession	because	he	thinks	he	has no	sin	to	confess,	for	the	Sacrament	of	Penance,	besides	forgiving	sin,	gives	an increase	of	sanctifying	grace,	and	of	this	we	have	always	need,	especially	to resist	temptation.	The	Saints,	who	were	almost	without	imperfection,	went	to confession	frequently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	784.	Should	a	person	go	to	Communion	after	confession	even	when	the confessor	does	not	bid	him	go?	A.	A	person	should	go	to	Communion	after confession	even	when	the	confessor	does	not	bid	him	go,	because	the	confessor so	intends	unless	he	positively	forbids	his	penitent	to	receive	Communion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	one	who	has	not	yet	received	his	first	Communion	should	not	go	to Communion	after	confession,	even	if	the	confessor	by	mistake	should	bid	him go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	785.	{210}	Which	are	the	chief	qualities	of	a	good	Confession?	A.	The	chief qualities	of	a	good	Confession	are	three:	it	must	be	humble,	sincere,	and	entire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>Q.	786.	{211}	When	is	our	Confession	humble?	A.	Our	Confession	is	humble when	we	accuse	ourselves	of	our	sins,	with	a	deep	sense	of	shame	and	sorrow for	having	offended	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	787.	{212}	When	is	our	Confession	sincere?	A.	Our	Confession	is	sincere when	we	tell	our	sins	honestly	and	truthfully,	neither	exaggerating	nor	excusing them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	788.	Why	is	it	wrong	to	accuse	ourselves	of	sins	we	have	not	committed?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	wrong	to	accuse	ourselves	of	sins	we	have	not	committed,	because,	by	our so	doing,	the	priest	cannot	know	the	true	state	of	our	souls,	as	he	must	do	before giving	us	absolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	789.	{213}	When	is	our	Confession	entire?	A.	Our	Confession	is	entire	when we	tell	the	number	and	kinds	of	our	sins	and	the	circumstances	which	change their	nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	790.	What	do	you	mean	by	the	"kinds	of	sin?"	A.	By	the	"kinds	of	sin,"	we mean	the	particular	division	or	class	to	which	the	sins	belong;	that	is,	whether they	be	sins	of	blasphemy,	disobedience,	anger,	impurity,	dishonesty,	&amp;c.	We	can determine	the	kind	of	sin	by	discovering	the	commandment	or	precept	of	the Church	we	have	broken	or	the	virtue	against	which	we	have	acted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	791.	What	do	we	mean	by	"circumstances	which	change	the	nature	of	sins?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	By	"circumstances	which	change	the	nature	of	sins"	we	mean	anything	that makes	it	another	kind	of	sin.	Thus	to	steal	is	a	sin,	but	to	steal	from	the	Church makes	our	theft	sacrilegious.	Again,	impure	actions	are	sins,	but	a	person	must say	whether	they	were	committed	alone	or	with	others,	with	relatives	or strangers,	with	persons	married	or	single,	&amp;c.,	because	these	circumstances change	them	from	one	kind	of	impurity	to	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	792.	{214}	What	should	we	do	if	we	cannot	remember	the	number	of	our sins?	A.	If	we	cannot	remember	the	number	of	our	sins,	we	should	tell	the number	as	nearly	as	possible,	and	say	how	often	we	may	have	sinned	in	a	day,	a week,	or	a	month,	and	how	long	the	habit	or	practice	has	lasted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	793.	{215}	Is	our	Confession	worthy	if,	without	our	fault,	we	forget to	confess	a	mortal	sin? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	If	without	our	fault	we	forget	to	confess	a	mortal	sin,	our Confession	is	worthy,	and	the	sin	is	forgiven;	but	it	must	be	told	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>Confession	if	it	again	comes	to	our	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	794.	May	a	person	who	has	forgotten	to	tell	a	mortal	sin	in	confession	go	to Holy	Communion	before	going	again	to	confession?	A.	A	person	who	has forgotten	to	tell	a	mortal	sin	in	confession	may	go	to	communion	before	again going	to	confession,	because	the	forgotten	sin	was	forgiven	with	those confessed,	and	the	confession	was	good	and	worthy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	795.	{216}	Is	it	a	grievous	offense	wilfully	to	conceal	a	mortal	sin in	Confession? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	It	is	a	grievous	offense	wilfully	to	conceal	a	mortal	sin	in Confession,	because	we	thereby	tell	a	lie	to	the	Holy	Ghost,	and	make our	Confession	worthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	796.	How	is	concealing	a	sin	telling	a	lie	to	the	Holy	Ghost?	A.	Concealing	a sin	is	telling	a	lie	to	the	Holy	Ghost,	because	he	who	conceals	the	sin	declares	in confession	to	God	and	the	priest	that	he	committed	no	sins	but	what	he	has confessed,	while	the	Holy	Ghost,	the	Spirit	of	Truth,	saw	him	committing	the	sin he	now	conceals	and	still	sees	it	in	his	soul	while	he	denies	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	797.	Why	is	it	foolish	to	conceal	sins	in	confession?	A.	It	is	foolish	to	conceal sins	in	confession:	(1)	Because	we	thereby	make	our	spiritual	condition	worse; (2)	We	must	tell	the	sin	sometime	if	we	ever	hope	to	be	saved;	(3)	It	will	be made	known	on	the	day	of	judgment,	before	the	world,	whether	we	conceal	it now	or	confess	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	798.	{217}	What	must	he	do	who	has	wilfully	concealed	a	mortal	sin	in Confession?	A.	He	who	has	wilfully	concealed	a	mortal	sin	in	Confession	must not	only	confess	it,	but	must	also	repeat	all	the	sins	he	has	committed	since	his last	worthy	Confession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	799.	Must	one	who	has	wilfully	concealed	a	mortal	sin	in	confession	do	more than	repeat	the	sins	committed	since	his	last	worthy	confession?	A.	One	who	has wilfully	concealed	a	mortal	sin	in	confession	must,	besides	repeating	all	the	sins he	has	committed	since	his	last	worthy	confession,	tell	also	how	often	he	has unworthily	received	absolution	and	Holy	Communion	during	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	800.	{218}	Why	does	the	priest	give	us	a	penance	after	Confession? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	priest	gives	us	a	penance	after	Confession,	that	we	may	satisfy God	for	the	temporal	punishment	due	to	our	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>Q.	801.	Why	should	we	have	to	satisfy	for	our	sins	if	Christ	has	fully	satisfied for	them?	A.	Christ	has	fully	satisfied	for	our	sins	and	after	our	baptism	we	were free	from	all	guilt	and	had	no	satisfaction	to	make.	But	when	we	wilfully	sinned after	baptism,	it	is	but	just	that	we	should	be	obliged	to	make	some	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	802.	Is	the	slight	penance	the	priest	gives	us	sufficient	to	satisfy	for	all	the sins	confessed?	A.	The	slight	penance	the	priest	gives	us	is	not	sufficient	to satisfy	for	all	the	sins	confessed:	(1)	Because	there	is	no	real	equality	between the	slight	penance	given	and	the	punishment	deserved	for	sin;	(2)	Because	we are	all	obliged	to	do	penance	for	sins	committed,	and	this	would	not	be necessary	if	the	penance	given	in	confession	satisfied	for	all.	The	penance	is given	and	accepted	in	confession	chiefly	to	show	our	willingness	to	do	penance and	make	amends	for	our	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	803.	{219}	Does	not	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	remit	all	punishment	due	to sin?	A.	The	Sacrament	of	Penance	remits	the	eternal	punishment	due	to	sin,	but it	does	not	always	remit	the	temporal	punishment	which	God	requires	as satisfaction	for	our	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	804.	{220}	Why	does	God	require	a	temporal	punishment	as	a satisfaction	for	sin? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	God	requires	a	temporal	punishment	as	a	satisfaction	for	sin	to	teach us	the	great	evil	of	sin	and	to	prevent	us	from	falling	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	805.	{221}	Which	are	the	chief	means	by	which	we	satisfy	God	for	the temporal	punishment	due	to	sin?	A.	The	chief	means	by	which	we	satisfy	God for	the	temporal	punishment	due	to	sin	are:	Prayer,	Fasting,	Almsgiving;	all spiritual	and	corporal	works	of	mercy,	and	the	patient	suffering	of	the	ills	of	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	806.	What	fasting	has	the	greatest	merit?	A.	The	fasting	imposed	by	the Church	on	certain	days	of	the	year,	and	particularly	during	Lent,	has	the	greatest merit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	807.	What	is	Lent? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Lent	is	the	forty	days	before	Easter	Sunday,	during	which	we	do penance,	fast	and	pray	to	prepare	ourselves	for	the	resurrection	of	Our Lord;	and	also	to	remind	us	of	His	own	fast	of	forty	days	before	His Passion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	808.	What	do	we	mean	by	"almsgiving"?	A.	By	almsgiving	we	mean	money, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>goods,	or	assistance	given	to	the	poor	or	to	charitable	purposes.	The	law	of	God requires	all	persons	to	give	alms	in	proportion	to	their	means. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	809.	What	"ills	of	life"	help	to	satisfy	God	for	sin?	A.	The	ills	of	life	that	help to	satisfy	God	for	sin	are	sickness,	poverty,	misfortune,	trial,	affliction,	&amp;c., especially,	when	we	have	not	brought	them	upon	ourselves	by	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	810.	How	did	the	Christians	in	the	first	ages	of	the	Church	do	Penance?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Christians	in	the	first	ages	of	the	Church	did	public	penance,	especially	for the	sins	of	which	they	were	publicly	known	to	be	guilty.	Penitents	were	excluded for	a	certain	time	from	Mass	or	the	Sacrament,	and	some	were	obliged	to	stand at	the	door	of	the	Church	begging	the	prayers	of	those	who	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	811.	What	were	these	severe	Penances	of	the	First	Ages	of	the	Church	called? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	These	severe	penances	of	the	first	ages	of	the	Church	were	called	canonical penances,	because	their	kind	and	duration	were	regulated	by	the	Canons	or	laws of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	812.	How	can	we	know	spiritual	from	corporal	works	of	mercy?	A.	We	can know	spiritual	from	corporal	works	of	mercy,	for	whatever	we	do	for	the	soul	is a	spiritual	work,	and	whatever	we	do	for	the	body	is	a	corporal	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	813.	{222}	Which	are	the	chief	spiritual	works	of	mercy?	A.	The	chief spiritual	works	of	mercy	are	seven:	To	admonish	the	sinner,	to	instruct	the ignorant,	to	counsel	the	doubtful,	to	comfort	the	sorrowful,	to	bear	wrongs patiently,	to	forgive	all	injuries,	and	to	pray	for	the	living	and	the	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	814.	When	are	we	bound	to	admonish	the	sinner?	A.	We	are	bound	to admonish	the	sinner	when	the	following	conditions	are	fulfilled:	(1)	When	his fault	is	a	mortal	sin;	(2)	When	we	have	authority	or	influence	over	him,	and	(3) When	there	is	reason	to	believe	that	our	warning	will	not	make	him	worse instead	of	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	815.	Who	are	meant	by	the	"ignorant"	we	are	to	instruct,	and	the	"doubtful" </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	are	to	counsel?	A.	By	the	ignorant	we	are	to	instruct	and	the	doubtful	we	are to	counsel,	are	meant	those	particularly	who	are	ignorant	of	the	truths	of	religion and	those	who	are	in	doubt	about	matters	of	faith.	We	must	aid	such	persons	as far	as	we	can	to	know	and	believe	the	truths	necessary	for	salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	816.	Why	are	we	advised	to	bear	wrong	patiently	and	to	forgive	all	injuries? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>A.	We	are	advised	to	bear	wrongs	patiently	and	to	forgive	all	injuries,	because, being	Christians,	we	should	imitate	the	example	of	Our	Divine	Lord,	who endured	wrongs	patiently	and	who	not	only	pardoned	but	prayed	for	those	who injured	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	817.	If,	then,	it	be	a	Christian	virtue	to	forgive	all	injuries,	why	do	Christians establish	courts	and	prisons	to	punish	wrongdoers?	A.	Christians	establish	courts and	prisons	to	punish	wrongdoers,	because	the	preservation	of	lawful	authority, good	order	in	society,	the	protection	of	others,	and	sometimes	even	the	good	of the	guilty	one	himself,	require	that	crimes	be	justly	punished.	As	God	Himself punishes	crime	and	as	lawful	authority	comes	from	Him,	such	authority	has	the right	to	punish,	though	individuals	should	forgive	the	injuries	done	to	themselves personally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	818.	Why	is	it	a	work	of	mercy	to	pray	for	the	living	and	the	dead?	A.	It	is	a work	of	mercy	to	aid	those	who	are	unable	to	aid	themselves.	The	living	are exposed	to	temptations,	and	while	in	mortal	sin	they	are	deprived	of	the	merit	of their	good	works	and	need	our	prayers.	The	dead	can	in	no	way	help	themselves and	depend	on	us	for	assistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	819.	{223}	Which	are	the	chief	corporal	works	of	mercy?	A.	The	chief corporal	works	of	mercy	are	seven:	To	feed	the	hungry,	to	give	drink	to	the thirsty,	to	clothe	the	naked,	to	ransom	the	captive,	to	harbor	the	harborless,	to visit	the	sick,	and	to	bury	the	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	820.	How	may	we	briefly	state	the	corporal	works	of	mercy?	A.	We	may briefly	state	the	corporal	works	of	mercy	by	saying	that	we	are	obliged	to	help the	poor	in	all	their	forms	of	want. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	821.	How	are	Christians	aided	in	the	performance	of	works	of	mercy?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christians	are	aided	in	the	performance	of	works	of	mercy	through	the establishment	of	charitable	institutions	where	religious	communities	of	holy	men or	women	perform	these	duties	for	us,	provided	we	supply	the	necessary	means by	our	almsgiving	and	good	works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	822.	Who	are	religious?	A.	Religious	are	self-sacrificing	men	and	women who,	wishing	to	follow	more	closely	the	teachings	of	Our	Lord,	dedicate	their lives	to	the	service	of	God	and	religion.	They	live	together	in	societies	approved by	the	Church,	under	a	rule	and	guidance	of	a	superior.	They	keep	the	vows	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>chastity,	poverty	and	obedience,	and	divide	their	time	between	prayer	and	good works.	The	houses	in	which	they	dwell	are	called	convents	or	monasteries,	and the	societies	in	which	they	live	are	called	religious	orders,	communities	or congregations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	823.	Are	there	any	religious	communities	of	priests?	A.	There	are	many religious	communities	of	priests,	who,	besides	living	according	to	the	general laws	of	the	Church,	as	all	priests	do,	follow	certain	rules	laid	down	for	their community.	Such	priests	are	called	the	regular	clergy,	because	living	by	rules	to distinguish	them	from	the	secular	clergy	who	live	in	their	parishes	under	no special	rule.	The	chief	work	of	the	regular	clergy	is	to	teach	in	colleges	and	give missions	and	retreats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	824.	Why	are	there	so	many	different	religious	communities?	A.	There	are many	different	religious	communities	(1)	because	all	religious	are	not	fitted	for the	same	work,	and	(2)	because	they	desire	to	imitate	Our	Lord's	life	on	earth	as perfectly	as	possible;	and	when	each	community	takes	one	of	Christ's	works	and seeks	to	become	perfect	in	it,	the	union	of	all	their	works	continues	as	perfectly as	we	can	the	works	He	began	upon	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	TWENTIETH.	ON	THE	MANNER	OF	MAKING	A</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">GOOD	CONFESSION. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	825.	{224}	What	should	we	do	on	entering	the	confessional? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	On	entering	the	confessional	we	should	kneel,	make	the	sign	of	the Cross,	and	say	to	the	priest,	"Bless	me,	father";	then	add,	"I	confess to	Almighty	God	and	to	you,	father,	that	I	have	sinned." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	826.	{225}	Which	are	the	first	things	we	should	tell	the	priest	in Confession? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	first	things	we	should	tell	the	priest	in	Confession	are	the	time of	our	last	Confession,	and	whether	we	said	the	penance	and	went	to	Holy Communion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	827.	Should	we	tell	anything	else	in	connection	with	our	last	confession?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	connection	with	our	last	confession	we	should	tell	also	what	restrictions—if</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>any—were	placed	upon	us	with	regard	to	our	occasions	of	sin,	and	what obligations	with	regard	to	the	payment	of	debts,	restitution,	injuries	done	to others	and	the	like,	we	were	commanded	to	fulfill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	828.	{226}	After	telling	the	time	of	our	last	Confession	and	Communion what	should	we	do?	A.	After	telling	the	time	of	our	last	Confession	and Communion	we	should	confess	all	the	mortal	sins	we	have	since	committed,	and all	the	venial	sins	we	may	wish	to	mention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	829.	What	is	a	general	confession?	A.	A	general	confession	is	the	telling	of the	sins	of	our	whole	life	or	a	great	part	of	it.	It	is	made	in	the	same	manner	as	an ordinary	confession,	except	that	it	requires	more	time	and	longer	preparation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	830.	When	should	a	General	Confession	be	made?	A.	A	general	confession (1)	is	necessary	when	we	are	certain	that	our	past	confessions	were	bad;	(2)	it	is useful	on	special	occasions	in	our	lives	when	some	change	in	our	way	of	living is	about	to	take	place;	(3)	it	is	hurtful	and	must	not	be	made	when	persons	are scrupulous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	831.	What	are	the	signs	of	scruples	and	the	remedy	against	them?	A.	The signs	of	scruples	are	chiefly:	(1)	To	be	always	dissatisfied	with	our	confessions; (2)	To	be	self-willed	in	deciding	what	is	sinful	and	what	is	not.	The	chief	remedy against	them	is	to	follow	exactly	the	advice	of	the	confessor	without	questioning the	reason	or	utility	of	his	advice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	832.	{227}	What	must	we	do	when	the	confessor	asks	us	questions?	A.	When the	confessor	asks	us	questions	we	must	answer	them	truthfully	and	clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	833.	{228}	What	should	we	do	after	telling	our	sins?	A.	After	telling	our	sins we	should	listen	with	attention	to	the	advice	which	the	confessor	may	think proper	to	give. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	834.	What	duties	does	the	priest	perform	in	the	confessional?	A.	In	the confessional	the	priest	performs	the	duties	(1)	of	a	judge,	by	listening	to	our	self-accusations	and	passing	sentence	upon	our	guilt	or	innocence;	(2)	Of	a	father,	by the	good	advice	and	encouragement	he	gives	us;	(3)	Of	a	teacher,	by	his instructions,	and	(4)	Of	a	physician,	by	discovering	the	afflictions	of	our	soul and	giving	us	the	remedies	to	restore	it	to	spiritual	health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	835.	Why	is	it	beneficial	to	go	always	if	possible	to	the	same	confessor?	A.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>is	beneficial	to	go	always,	if	possible,	to	the	same	confessor,	because	our continued	confessions	enable	him	to	see	more	clearly	the	true	state	of	our	soul and	to	understand	better	our	occasions	of	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	836.	Should	we	remain	away	from	confession	because	we	cannot	go	to	our usual	confessor?	A.	We	should	not	remain	away	from	confession	because	we cannot	go	to	our	usual	confessor,	for	though	it	is	well	to	confess	to	the	same priest,	it	is	not	necessary	to	do	so.	One	should	never	become	so	attached	to	a confessor	that	his	absence	or	the	great	inconvenience	of	going	to	him	would become	an	excuse	for	neglecting	the	Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	837.	{229}	How	should	we	end	our	Confession?	A.	We	should	end	our Confession	by	saying,	"I	also	accuse	myself	of	all	the	sins	of	my	past	life," </p>
<p class="calibre1">telling,	if	we	choose,	one	or	several	of	our	past	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	838.	{230}	What	should	we	do	while	the	priest	is	giving	us absolution? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	While	the	priest	is	giving	us	absolution	we	should	from	our	heart renew	the	Act	of	Contrition. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	TWENTY-FIRST.	ON	INDULGENCES. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	839.	{231}	What	is	an	Indulgence?	A.	An	Indulgence	is	the	remission	in whole	or	in	part	of	the	temporal	punishment	due	to	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	840.	What	does	the	word	"indulgence"	mean?	A.	The	word	indulgence	means a	favor	or	concession.	An	indulgence	obtains	by	a	very	slight	penance	the remission	of	penalties	that	would	otherwise	be	severe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	841.	{232}	Is	an	Indulgence	a	pardon	of	sin,	or	a	license	to	commit sin? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	An	Indulgence	is	not	a	pardon	of	sin,	nor	a	license	to	commit	sin, and	one	who	is	in	a	state	of	mortal	sin	cannot	gain	an	Indulgence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	842.	How	do	good	works	done	in	mortal	sin	profit	us?	A.	Good	works	done in	mortal	sin	profit	us	by	obtaining	for	us	the	grace	to	repent	and	sometimes temporal	blessings.	Mortal	sin	deprives	us	of	all	our	merit,	nevertheless	God	will</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>bestow	gifts	for	every	good	deed	as	He	will	punish	every	evil	deed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	843.	{233}	How	many	kinds	of	Indulgences	are	there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	There	are	two	kinds	of	Indulgences—Plenary	and	Partial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	844.	{234}	What	is	Plenary	Indulgence?	A.	A	Plenary	Indulgence	is	the	full remission	of	the	temporal	punishment	due	to	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	845.	Is	it	easy	to	gain	a	Plenary	Indulgence?	A.	It	is	not	easy	to	gain	a	Plenary Indulgence,	as	we	may	understand	from	its	great	privilege.	To	gain	a	Plenary Indulgence,	we	must	hate	sin,	be	heartily	sorry	for	even	our	venial	sins,	and	have no	desire	for	even	the	slightest	sin.	Though	we	may	not	gain	entirely	each Plenary	Indulgence	we	seek,	we	always	gain	a	part	of	each;	that	is,	a	partial indulgence,	greater	or	less	in	proportion	to	our	good	dispositions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	846.	Which	are	the	most	important	Plenary	Indulgences	granted	by	the Church?	A.	The	most	important	Plenary	Indulgences	granted	by	the	Church	are (1)	The	Indulgences	of	a	jubilee	which	the	Pope	grants	every	twenty-five	years or	on	great	occasions	by	which	he	gives	special	faculties	to	confessors	for	the absolution	of	reserved	sins;	(2)	The	Indulgence	granted	to	the	dying	in	their	last agony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	847.	{235}	What	is	a	Partial	Indulgence?	A.	A	Partial	Indulgence	is	the remission	of	part	of	the	temporal	punishment	due	to	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	848.	How	long	has	the	practice	of	granting	Indulgences	been	in	use	in	the Church,	and	what	was	its	origin?	A.	The	practice	of	granting	Indulgences	has been	in	use	in	the	Church	since	the	time	of	the	apostles.	It	had	its	origin	in	the earnest	prayers	of	holy	persons,	and	especially	of	the	martyrs	begging	the Church	for	their	sake	to	shorten	the	severe	penances	of	sinners,	or	to	change them	into	lighter	penances.	The	request	was	frequently	granted	and	the	penance remitted,	shortened	or	changed,	and	with	the	penance	remitted	the	temporal punishment	corresponding	to	it	was	blotted	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	849.	How	do	we	show	that	the	Church	has	the	power	to	grant	Indulgences?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	show	that	the	Church	has	the	power	to	grant	Indulgences,	because	Christ	has given	it	power	to	remit	all	guilt	without	restriction,	and	if	the	Church	has	power, in	the	Sacrament	of	penance,	to	remit	the	eternal	punishment—which	is	the greatest—it	must	have	power	to	remit	the	temporal	or	lesser	punishment,	even outside	the	Sacrament	of	Penance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>Q.	850.	How	do	we	know	that	these	Indulgences	have	their	effect?	A.	We	know that	these	Indulgences	have	their	effect,	because	the	Church,	through	her councils,	declares	Indulgences	useful,	and	if	they	have	no	effect	they	would	be useless,	and	the	Church	would	teach	error	in	spite	of	Christ's	promise	to	guide	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	851.	Have	there	ever	existed	abuses	among	the	faithful	in	the	manner	of	using Indulgences?	A.	There	have	existed,	in	past	ages,	some	abuses	among	the faithful	in	the	manner	of	using	Indulgences,	and	the	Church	has	always	labored to	correct	such	abuses	as	soon	as	possible.	In	the	use	of	pious	practices	we	must be	always	guided	by	our	lawful	superiors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	852.	How	have	the	enemies	of	the	Church	made	use	of	the	abuse	of Indulgences?	A.	The	enemies	of	the	Church	have	made	use	of	the	abuse	of Indulgences	to	deny	the	doctrine	of	Indulgences,	and	to	break	down	the	teaching and	limit	the	power	of	the	Church.	Not	to	be	deceived	in	matters	of	faith,	we must	always	distinguish	very	carefully	between	the	abuses	to	which	a	devotion may	lead	and	the	truths	upon	which	the	devotion	rests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	853.	{236}	How	does	the	Church	by	means	of	Indulgences	remit	the	temporal punishment	due	to	sin?	A.	The	Church,	by	means	of	Indulgences,	remits	the temporal	punishment	due	to	sin	by	applying	to	us	the	merits	of	Jesus	Christ,	and the	superabundant	satisfactions	of	the	Blessed	Virgin	Mary	and	of	the	saints; which	merits	and	satisfactions	are	its	spiritual	treasury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	854.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	"superabundant	satisfaction	of	the	Blessed Virgin	and	the	Saints"?	A.	By	the	superabundant	satisfaction	of	the	Blessed Virgin	and	the	saints,	we	mean	all	the	satisfaction	over	and	above	what	was necessary	to	satisfy	for	their	own	sins.	As	their	good	works	were	many	and	their sins	few—the	Blessed	Virgin	being	sinless—the	satisfaction	not	needed	for themselves	is	kept	by	the	Church	in	a	spiritual	treasury	to	be	used	for	our benefit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	855.	Does	the	Church,	by	granting	Indulgences,	free	us	from	doing	Penance? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church,	by	granting	Indulgences,	does	not	free	us	from	doing	penance, but	simply	makes	our	penance	lighter	that	we	may	more	easily	satisfy	for	our sins	and	escape	the	punishments	they	deserve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	856.	Who	has	the	power	to	grant	Indulgences? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Pope	alone	has	the	power	to	grant	Indulgences	for	the	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>Church;	but	the	bishops	have	power	to	grant	partial	Indulgences	in	their own	diocese.	Cardinals	and	some	others,	by	the	special	permission	of	the Pope,	have	the	right	to	grant	certain	Indulgences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	857.	Where	shall	we	find	the	Indulgences	granted	by	the	Church?	A.	We	shall find	the	Indulgences	granted	by	the	Church	in	the	declarations	of	the	Pope	and	of the	Sacred	Congregation	of	Cardinals.	These	declarations	are	usually	put	into prayer	books	and	books	of	devotion	or	instruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	858.	{237}	What	must	we	do	to	gain	an	Indulgence?	A.	To	gain	an Indulgence	we	must	be	in	the	state	of	grace	and	perform	the	works	enjoined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	859.	Besides	being	in	a	state	of	grace	and	performing	the	works	enjoined, what	else	is	necessary	for	the	gaining	of	an	Indulgence?	A.	Besides	being	in	a state	of	grace	and	performing	the	works	enjoined,	it	is	necessary	for	the	gaining of	an	Indulgence	to	have	at	least	the	general	intention	of	gaining	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	860.	How	and	why	should	we	make	a	general	intention	to	gain	all	possible Indulgences	each	day?	A.	We	should	make	a	general	intention	at	our	morning prayers	to	gain	all	possible	Indulgences	each	day,	because	several	of	the	prayers we	say	and	good	works	we	perform	may	have	Indulgences	attached	to	them, though	we	are	not	aware	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	861.	What	works	are	generally	enjoined	for	the	gaining	of	Indulgences?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	works	generally	enjoined	for	the	gaining	of	Indulgences	are:	The	saying	of certain	prayers,	fasting,	and	the	use	of	certain	articles	of	devotion;	visits	to Churches	or	altars,	and	the	giving	of	alms.	For	the	gaining	of	Plenary Indulgences	it	is	generally	required	to	go	to	confession	and	Holy	Communion and	pray	for	the	intention	of	the	Pope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	862.	What	does	praying	for	a	person's	intention	mean?	A.	Praying	for	a person's	intention	means	praying	for	whatever	he	prays	for	or	desires	to	obtain through	prayer—some	spiritual	or	temporal	favors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	863.	What	does	an	Indulgence	of	forty	days	mean?	A.	An	Indulgence	of	forty days	means	that	for	the	prayer	or	work	to	which	an	Indulgence	of	forty	days	is attached,	God	remits	as	much	of	our	temporal	punishment	as	He	remitted	for forty	days'	canonical	penance.	We	do	not	know	just	how	much	temporal punishment	God	remitted	for	forty	days'	public	penance,	but	whatever	it	was,	He remits	the	same	now	when	we	gain	an	Indulgence	of	forty	days.	The	same	rule</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>applies	to	Indulgences	of	a	year	or	any	length	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	864.	Why	did	the	Church	moderate	its	severe	penances?	A.	The	Church moderated	its	severe	penances,	because	when	Christians—terrified	by persecution—grew	weaker	in	their	faith,	there	was	danger	of	some	abandoning their	religion	rather	than	submit	to	the	penances	imposed.	The	Church,	therefore, wishing	to	save	as	many	as	possible,	made	the	sinner's	penance	as	light	as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	865.	To	what	things	may	Indulgences	be	attached?	A.	Plenary	or	Partial Indulgences	may	be	attached	to	prayers	and	solid	articles	of	devotion;	to	places such	as	churches,	altars,	shrines,	&amp;c.,	to	be	visited;	and	by	a	special	privilege they	are	sometimes	attached	to	the	good	works	of	certain	persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	866.	When	do	things	lose	the	Indulgences	attached	to	them?	A.	Things	lose the	Indulgences	attached	to	them:	(1)	When	they	are	so	changed	at	once	as	to	be no	longer	what	they	were;	(2)	When	they	are	sold.	Rosaries	and	other indulgenced	articles	do	not	lose	their	indulgences,	when	they	are	loaned	or	given away,	for	the	indulgence	is	not	personal	but	attached	to	the	article	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	867.	Will	a	weekly	Confession	suffice	to	gain	during	the	week	all Indulgences	to	which	Confession	is	enjoined	as	one	of	the	works?	A.	Weekly confession	will	suffice	to	gain	during	the	week	all	Indulgences	to	which confession	is	enjoined	as	one	of	the	works,	provided	we	continue	in	a	state	of grace,	perform	the	other	works	enjoined	and	have	the	intention	of	gaining	these Indulgences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	868.	How	and	when	may	we	apply	Indulgences	for	the	benefit	of	the	souls	in Purgatory?	A.	We	may	apply	Indulgences	for	the	benefit	of	the	souls	in Purgatory	by	way	of	intercession;	whenever	this	application	is	mentioned	and permitted	by	the	Church	in	granting	the	Indulgence;	that	is,	when	the	Church declares	that	the	Indulgence	granted	is	applicable	to	the	souls	of	the	living	or	the souls	in	Purgatory;	so	that	we	may	gain	it	for	the	benefit	of	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	TWENTY-SECOND.	ON	THE	HOLY	EUCHARIST. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>Q.	869.	What	does	the	word	Eucharist	strictly	mean?	A.	The	word	Eucharist strictly	means	pleasing,	and	this	Sacrament	is	so	called	because	it	renders	us most	pleasing	to	God	by	the	grace	it	imparts,	and	it	gives	us	the	best	means	of thanking	Him	for	all	His	blessings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	870.	{238}	What	is	the	Holy	Eucharist?	A.	The	Holy	Eucharist	is	the Sacrament	which	contains	the	body	and	blood,	soul	and	divinity,	of	our	Lord Jesus	Christ	under	the	appearances	of	bread	and	wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	871.	What	do	we	mean	when	we	say	the	Sacrament	which	contains	the	Body and	Blood?	A.	When	we	say	the	Sacrament	which	contains	the	Body	and	Blood, we	mean	the	Sacrament	which	is	the	Body	and	Blood,	for	after	the	Consecration there	is	no	other	substance	present	in	the	Eucharist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	872.	When	is	the	Holy	Eucharist	a	Sacrament,	and	when	is	it	a	sacrifice?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Holy	Eucharist	is	a	Sacrament	when	we	receive	it	in	Holy	Communion	and when	it	remains	in	the	Tabernacle	of	the	Altar.	It	is	a	sacrifice	when	it	is	offered up	at	Mass	by	the	separate	Consecration	of	the	bread	and	wine,	which	signifies the	separation	of	Our	Lord's	blood	from	His	body	when	He	died	on	the	Cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	873.	{239}	When	did	Christ	institute	the	Holy	Eucharist?	A.	Christ	instituted the	Holy	Eucharist	at	the	Last	Supper,	the	night	before	He	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	874.	{240}	Who	were	present	when	our	Lord	instituted	the	Holy Eucharist? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	When	Our	Lord	instituted	the	Holy	Eucharist,	the	twelve	Apostles	were present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	875.	{241}	How	did	our	Lord	institute	the	Holy	Eucharist?	A.	Our	Lord instituted	the	Holy	Eucharist	by	taking	bread,	blessing,	breaking,	and	giving	to His	Apostles,	saying:	"Take	ye	and	eat.	This	is	my	body";	and	then,	by	taking	the cup	of	wine,	blessing	and	giving	it,	saying	to	them:	"Drink	ye	all	of	this.	This	is my	blood	which	shall	be	shed	for	the	remission	of	sins.	Do	this	for	a commemoration	of	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	876.	{242}	What	happened	when	our	Lord	said,	"This	is	my	body;	this	is	my blood"?	A.	When	Our	Lord	said,	"This	is	my	body,"	the	substance	of	the	bread was	changed	into	the	substance	of	His	body;	when	He	said,	"This	is	my	blood," </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	substance	of	the	wine	was	changed	into	the	substance	of	His	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>Q.	877.	How	do	we	prove	the	Real	Presence,	that	is,	that	Our	Lord	is	really	and truly	present	in	the	Holy	Eucharist?	A.	We	prove	the	Real	Presence—that	is,	that Our	Lord	is	really	and	truly	present	in	the	Holy	Eucharist—(1)	By	showing	that it	is	possible	to	change	one	substance	into	another;	(2)	By	showing	that	Christ did	change	the	substance	of	bread	and	wine	into	the	substance	of	His	body	and blood;	(3)	By	showing	that	He	gave	this	power	also	to	His	Apostles	and	to	the priests	of	His	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	878.	How	do	we	know	that	it	is	possible	to	change	one	substance	into another?	A.	We	know	that	it	is	possible	to	change	one	substance	into	another, because	(1)	God	changed	water	into	blood	during	the	plagues	of	Egypt;	(2) Christ	changed	water	into	wine	at	the	marriage	of	Cana;	(3)	Our	own	food	is daily	changed	into	the	substance	of	our	flesh	and	blood;	and	what	God	does gradually,	He	can	also	do	instantly	by	an	act	of	His	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	879.	Are	these	changes	exactly	the	same	as	the	changes	that	take	place	in	the Holy	Eucharist?	A.	These	changes	are	not	exactly	the	same	as	the	changes	that take	place	in	the	Holy	Eucharist,	for	in	these	changes	the	appearance	also	is changed,	but	in	the	Holy	Eucharist	only	the	substance	is	changed	while	the appearance	remains	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	880.	How	do	we	show	that	Christ	did	change	bread	and	wine	into	the substance	of	His	body	and	blood?	A.	We	show	that	Christ	did	change	bread	and wine	into	the	substance	of	His	body	and	blood:	(1)	From	the	words	by	which	He promised	the	Holy	Eucharist;	(2)	From	the	words	by	which	He	instituted	the Holy	Eucharist;	(3)	From	the	constant	use	of	the	Holy	Eucharist	in	the	Church since	the	time	of	the	Apostles;	(4)	From	the	impossibility	of	denying	the	Real Presence	in	the	Holy	Eucharist,	without	likewise	denying	all	that	Christ	has taught	and	done;	for	we	have	stronger	proofs	for	the	Holy	Eucharist	than	for	any other	Christian	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	881.	{243}	Is	Jesus	Christ	whole	and	entire	both	under	the	form	of	bread	and under	the	form	of	wine?	A.	Jesus	Christ	is	whole	and	entire	both	under	the	form of	bread	and	under	the	form	of	wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	882.	How	do	we	know	that	under	the	appearance	of	bread	we	receive	also Christ's	blood;	and	under	the	appearance	of	wine	we	receive	also	Christ's	body? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	know	that	under	the	appearance	of	bread	we	receive	also	Christ's	blood, and	under	the	appearance	of	wine	we	receive	also	Christ's	body;	because	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>Holy	Eucharist	we	receive	the	living	body	of	Our	Lord,	and	a	living	body	cannot exist	without	blood,	nor	can	living	blood	exist	without	a	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	883.	Is	Jesus	Christ	present	whole	and	entire	in	the	smallest	portion	of	the Holy	Eucharist,	under	the	form	of	either	bread	or	wine?	A.	Jesus	Christ	is present	whole	and	entire	in	the	smallest	portion	of	the	Holy	Eucharist	under	the form	of	either	bread	or	wine;	for	His	body	in	the	Eucharist	is	in	a	glorified	state, and	as	it	partakes	of	the	character	of	a	spiritual	substance,	it	requires	no	definite size	or	shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	884.	{244}	Did	anything	remain	of	the	bread	and	wine	after	their	substance had	been	changed	into	the	substance	of	the	body	and	blood	of	our	Lord?	A.	After the	substance	of	the	bread	and	wine	had	been	changed	into	the	substance	of	the body	and	blood	of	Our	Lord,	there	remained	only	the	appearances	of	bread	and wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	885.	{245}	What	do	you	mean	by	the	appearances	of	bread	and	wine?	A.	By the	appearances	of	bread	and	wine	I	mean	the	figure,	the	color,	the	taste,	and whatever	appears	to	the	senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	886.	{246}	What	is	this	change	of	the	bread	and	wine	into	the	body	and	blood of	our	Lord	called?	A.	This	change	of	the	bread	and	wine	into	the	body	and blood	of	Our	Lord	is	called	Transubstantiation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	887.	What	is	the	second	great	miracle	in	the	Holy	Eucharist?	A.	The	second great	miracle	in	the	Holy	Eucharist	is	the	multiplication	of	the	presence	of	Our Lord's	body	in	so	many	places	at	the	same	time,	while	the	body	itself	is	not multiplied—for	there	is	but	one	body	of	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	888.	Are	there	not,	then,	as	many	bodies	of	Christ	as	there	are	tabernacles	in the	world,	or	as	there	are	Masses	being	said	at	the	same	time?	A.	There	are	not as	many	bodies	of	Christ	as	there	are	tabernacles	in	the	world,	or	as	there	are Masses	being	said	at	the	same	time;	but	only	one	body	of	Christ,	which	is everywhere	present	whole	and	entire	in	the	Holy	Eucharist,	as	God	is everywhere	present,	while	He	is	but	one	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	889.	{247}	How	was	the	substance	of	the	bread	and	wine	changed	into	the substance	of	the	body	and	blood	of	Christ?	A.	The	substance	of	the	bread	and wine	was	changed	into	the	substance	of	the	body	and	blood	of	Christ	by	His almighty	power. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>Q.	890.	{248}	Does	this	change	of	bread	and	wine	into	the	body	and	blood	of Christ	continue	to	be	made	in	the	Church?	A.	This	change	of	bread	and	wine	into the	body	and	blood	of	Christ	continues	to	be	made	in	the	Church	by	Jesus	Christ through	the	ministry	of	His	priests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	891.	{249}	When	did	Christ	give	His	priests	the	power	to	change	bread	and wine	into	His	body	and	blood?	A.	Christ	gave	His	priests	the	power	to	change bread	and	wine	into	His	body	and	blood	when	He	said	to	the	Apostles,	"Do	this in	commemoration	of	Me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	892.	What	do	the	words	"Do	this	in	commemoration	of	Me"	mean?	A.	The words	"Do	this	in	commemoration	of	Me"	mean:	Do	what	I,	Christ,	am	doing	at My	last	supper,	namely,	changing	the	substance	of	bread	and	wine	into	the substance	of	My	body	and	blood;	and	do	it	in	remembrance	of	Me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	893.	{250}	How	do	the	priests	exercise	this	power	of	changing	bread	and wine	into	the	body	and	blood	of	Christ?	A.	The	priests	exercise	this	power	of changing	bread	and	wine	into	the	body	and	blood	of	Christ	through	the	words	of consecration	in	the	Mass,	which	are	words	of	Christ:	"This	is	my	body;	this	is my	blood." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	894.	At	what	part	of	the	Mass	does	the	Consecration	take	place?	A.	The Consecration	in	the	Mass	takes	place	immediately	before	the	elevation	of	the Host	and	Chalice,	which	are	raised	above	the	head	of	the	priest	that	the	people may	adore	Our	Lord	who	has	just	come	to	the	altar	at	the	words	of	Consecration. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HOLY	EUCHARIST	WAS	INSTITUTED. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	895.	{251}	Why	did	Christ	institute	the	Holy	Eucharist? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Christ	instituted	the	Holy	Eucharist—</p>
<p class="calibre1">1.	To	unite	us	to	Himself	and	to	nourish	our	soul	with	His	divine	life.	2.	To increase	sanctifying	grace	and	all	virtues	in	our	soul.	3.	To	lessen	our	evil inclinations.	4.	To	be	a	pledge	of	everlasting	life.	5.	To	fit	our	bodies	for	a glorious	resurrection.	6.	To	continue	the	sacrifice	of	the	Cross	in	His	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>Q.	896.	Has	the	Holy	Eucharist	any	other	effect?	A.	The	Holy	Eucharist	remits venial	sins	by	disposing	us	to	perform	acts	of	love	and	contrition.	It	preserves	us from	mortal	sin	by	exciting	us	to	greater	fervor	and	strengthening	us	against temptation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	897.	{252}	How	are	we	united	to	Jesus	Christ	in	the	Holy	Eucharist? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	are	united	to	Jesus	Christ	in	the	Holy	Eucharist	by	means	of	Holy Communion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	898.	{253}	What	is	Holy	Communion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Holy	Communion	is	the	receiving	of	the	body	and	blood	of	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	899.	Is	it	not	beneath	the	dignity	of	Our	Lord	to	enter	our	bodies	under	the appearance	of	ordinary	food?	A.	It	is	not	beneath	the	dignity	of	Our	Lord	to enter	our	bodies	under	the	appearance	of	ordinary	food	any	more	than	it	was beneath	His	dignity	to	enter	the	body	of	His	Blessed	Mother	and	remain	there	as an	ordinary	child	for	nine	months.	Christ's	dignity,	being	infinite,	can	never	be diminished	by	any	act	on	His	own	or	on	our	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	900.	Why	does	not	the	Church	give	Holy	Communion	to	the	people	as	it	does to	the	priest	under	the	appearance	of	wine	also?	A.	The	Church	does	not	give Holy	Communion	to	the	people	as	it	does	to	the	priest	under	the	appearance	of wine	also,	to	avoid	the	danger	of	spilling	the	Precious	Blood;	to	prevent	the irreverence	some	might	show	if	compelled	to	drink	out	of	a	chalice	used	by	all, and	lastly,	to	refute	those	who	denied	that	Our	Lord's	blood	is	present	under	the appearance	of	bread	also. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	901.	{254}	What	is	necessary	to	make	a	good	Communion?	A.	To	make	a good	Communion	it	is	necessary	to	be	in	the	state	of	sanctifying	grace	and	to fast	according	to	the	laws	of	the	Church. </p>

It	is	not	a	sin	to	break	one's fast,	but	it	would	be	a	mortal	sin	to	receive	Holy	Communion	after	knowingly breaking	the	fast	necessary	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	903.	{255}	Does	he	who	receives	Communion	in	mortal	sin	receive	the	body</p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	904.	{256}	Is	it	enough	to	be	free	from	mortal	sin	to	receive	plentifully	the graces	of	Holy	Communion?	A.	To	receive	plentifully	the	graces	of	Holy Communion	it	is	not	enough	to	be	free	from	mortal	sin,	but	we	should	be	free from	all	affection	to	venial	sin,	and	should	make	acts	of	lively	faith,	of	firm hope,	and	ardent	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	905.	{257}	What	is	the	fast	necessary	for	Holy	Communion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	fast	necessary	for	Holy	Communion	is	the	abstaining	from	food, alcoholic	drinks	and	non-alcoholic	drinks	for	one	hour	before	Holy Communion.	Water	does	not	break	the	fast. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	906.	Does	medicine	taken	by	necessity	or	food	taken	by	accident	break the	fast	for	Holy	Communion? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	908.	Is	the	Holy	Communion	called	by	any	other	name	when	given	to	one	in danger	of	death?	A.	When	the	Holy	Communion	is	given	to	one	in	danger	of death,	it	is	called	Viaticum,	and	is	given	with	its	own	form	of	prayer.	In	giving Holy	Communion	the	priest	says:	"May	the	body	of	Our	Lord	Jesus	Christ	guard your	soul	to	eternal	life."	In	giving	Holy	Viaticum	he	says:	"Receive,	brother	(or sister),	the	Viaticum	of	the	body	of	Our	Lord	Jesus	Christ,	which	will	guard	you from	the	wicked	enemy	and	lead	you	into	eternal	life." </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>Q.	910.	{260}	Is	it	well	to	receive	Holy	Communion	often? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	It	is	well	to	receive	Holy	Communion	often,	as	nothing	is	a	greater aid	to	a	holy	life	than	often	to	receive	the	Author	of	all	grace	and	the Source	of	all	good. </p>

A	spiritual	communion	is	an	earnest desire	to	receive	Communion	in	reality,	by	which	desire	we	make	all preparations	and	thanksgivings	that	we	would	make	in	case	we	really	received the	Holy	Eucharist.	Spiritual	Communion	is	an	act	of	devotion	that	must	be pleasing	to	God	and	bring	us	blessings	from	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	913.	{261}	What	should	we	do	after	Holy	Communion?	A.	After	Holy Communion	we	should	spend	some	time	in	adoring	Our	Lord,	in	thanking	Him for	the	grace	we	have	received,	and	in	asking	Him	for	the	blessings	we	need. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	914.	What	length	of	time	should	we	spend	in	thanksgiving	after	Holy Communion?	A.	We	should	spend	sufficient	time	in	Thanksgiving	after	Holy Communion	to	show	due	reverence	to	the	Blessed	Sacrament;	for	Our	Lord	is personally	with	us	as	long	as	the	appearance	of	bread	and	wine	remains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	915.	What	should	we	be	particular	about	when	receiving	Holy	Communion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	When	receiving	Holy	Communion	we	should	be	particular:	(1)	About	the respectful	manner	in	which	we	approach	and	return	from	the	altar;	(2)	About	our personal	appearance,	especially	neatness	and	cleanliness;	(3)	About	raising	our head,	opening	our	mouth	and	putting	forth	the	tongue	in	the	proper	manner;	(4) About	swallowing	the	Sacred	Host;	(5)	About	removing	it	carefully	with	the tongue,	in	case	it	should	stick	to	the	mouth,	but	never	with	the	finger	under	any circumstances. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MASS. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	916.	{262}	When	and	where	are	the	bread	and	wine	changed	into	the body	and	blood	of	Christ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	bread	and	wine	are	changed	into	the	body	and	blood	of	Christ	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>the	Consecration	in	the	Mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	917.	{263}	What	is	the	Mass? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Mass	is	the	unbloody	sacrifice	of	the	body	and	blood	of	Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	918.	Why	is	this	Sacrifice	called	the	Mass? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	This	Sacrifice	is	called	the	"Mass"	very	probably	from	the	words	"Ite Missa	est,"	used	by	the	priest	as	he	tells	the	people	to	depart	when	the Holy	Sacrifice	is	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	919.	{264}	What	is	a	sacrifice?	A.	A	sacrifice	is	the	offering	of	an	object	by	a priest	to	God	alone,	and	the	consuming	of	it	to	acknowledge	that	He	is	the Creator	and	Lord	of	all	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	920.	{265}	Is	the	Mass	the	same	sacrifice	as	that	of	the	Cross? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Mass	is	the	same	sacrifice	as	that	of	the	Cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	921.	{266}	How	is	the	Mass	the	same	sacrifice	as	that	of	the	Cross?	A.	The Mass	is	the	same	sacrifice	as	that	of	the	Cross	because	the	offering	and	the	priest are	the	same—Christ	our	Blessed	Lord;	and	the	ends	for	which	the	sacrifice	of the	Mass	is	offered	are	the	same	as	those	of	the	sacrifice	of	the	Cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	922.	{267}	What	were	the	ends	for	which	the	sacrifice	of	the	Cross	was offered?	A.	The	ends	for	which	the	sacrifice	of	the	Cross	was	offered	were:	1st, To	honor	and	glorify	God;	2nd,	To	thank	Him	for	all	the	graces	bestowed	on	the whole	world;	3rd,	To	satisfy	God's	justice	for	the	sins	of	men;	4th,	To	obtain	all graces	and	blessings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	923.	How	are	the	fruits	of	the	Mass	distributed?	A.	The	fruits	of	the	Mass	are distributed	thus:	The	first	benefit	is	bestowed	on	the	priest	who	says	the	Mass; the	second	on	the	person	for	whom	the	Mass	is	said,	or	for	the	intention	for which	it	is	said;	the	third	on	those	who	are	present	at	the	Mass,	and	particularly on	those	who	serve	it,	and	the	fourth	on	all	the	faithful	who	are	in	communion with	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	924.	Are	all	Masses	of	equal	value	in	themselves	or	do	they	differ	in	worth? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	All	Masses	are	equal	in	value	in	themselves	and	do	not	differ	in	worth,	but only	in	the	solemnity	with	which	they	are	celebrated	or	in	the	end	for	which	they are	offered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>Q.	925.	How	are	Masses	distinguished?	A.	Masses	are	distinguished	thus:	(1) When	the	Mass	is	sung	by	a	bishop,	assisted	by	a	deacon	and	sub-deacon,	it	is called	a	Pontifical	Mass;	(2)	When	it	is	sung	by	a	priest,	assisted	by	a	deacon and	sub-deacon,	it	is	called	a	Solemn	Mass;	(3)	When	sung	by	a	priest	without deacon	and	sub-deacon,	it	is	called	a	Missa	Cantata	or	High	Mass;	(4)	When	the Mass	is	only	read	in	a	low	tone	it	is	called	a	low	or	private	Mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	926.	For	what	end	or	intention	may	Mass	be	offered?	A.	Mass	may	be	offered for	any	end	or	intention	that	tends	to	the	honor	and	glory	of	God,	to	the	good	of the	Church	or	the	welfare	of	man;	but	never	for	any	object	that	is	bad	in	itself,	or in	its	aims;	neither	can	it	be	offered	publicly	for	persons	who	are	not	members	of the	true	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	927.	Explain	what	is	meant	by	Requiem,	Nuptial	and	Votive	Masses.	A.	A Requiem	Mass	is	one	said	in	black	vestments	and	with	special	prayers	for	the dead.	A	Nuptial	Mass	is	one	said	at	the	marriage	of	two	Catholics,	and	it	has special	prayers	for	their	benefit.	A	Votive	Mass	is	one	said	in	honor	of	some particular	mystery	or	saint,	on	a	day	not	set	apart	by	the	Church	for	the	honor	of that	mystery	or	saint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	928.	From	what	may	we	learn	that	we	are	to	offer	up	the	Holy	Sacrifice	with the	priest?	A.	We	may	learn	that	we	are	to	offer	up	the	Holy	Sacrifice	with	the priest	from	the	words	used	in	the	Mass	itself;	for	the	priest,	after	offering	up	the bread	and	wine	for	the	Sacrifice,	turns	to	the	people	and	says:	"Orate	Fratres," </p>
<p class="calibre1">&amp;c.,	which	means:	"Pray,	brethren,	that	my	sacrifice	and	yours	may	be acceptable	to	God	the	Father	Almighty,"	and	the	server	answers	in	our	name:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"May	the	Lord	receive	the	sacrifice	from	thy	hands	to	the	praise	and	glory	of	His own	name,	and	to	our	benefit	and	that	of	all	His	Holy	Church." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	929.	From	what	did	the	custom	of	making	an	offering	to	the	priest	for	saying Mass	arise?	A.	The	custom	of	making	an	offering	to	the	priest	for	saying	Mass arose	from	the	old	custom	of	bringing	to	the	priest	the	bread	and	wine	necessary for	the	celebration	of	Mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	930.	Is	it	not	simony,	or	the	buying	of	a	sacred	thing,	to	offer	the	priest	money for	saying	Mass	for	your	intention?	A.	It	is	not	simony,	or	the	buying	of	a	sacred thing,	to	offer	the	priest	money	for	saying	Mass	for	our	intention,	because	the priest	does	not	take	the	money	for	the	Mass	itself,	but	for	the	purpose	of supplying	the	things	necessary	for	Mass	and	for	his	own	support. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>Q.	931.	{268}	Is	there	any	difference	between	the	sacrifice	of	the	Cross	and	the sacrifice	of	the	Mass?	A.	Yes;	the	manner	in	which	the	sacrifice	is	offered	is different.	On	the	Cross	Christ	really	shed	His	blood	and	was	really	slain;	in	the Mass	there	is	no	real	shedding	of	blood	nor	real	death,	because	Christ	can	die	no more;	but	the	sacrifice	of	the	Mass,	through	the	separate	consecration	of	the bread	and	the	wine,	represents	His	death	on	the	Cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	932.	What	are	the	chief	parts	of	the	Mass?	A.	The	chief	parts	of	the	Mass	are: (1)	The	Offertory,	at	which	the	priests	offers	to	God	the	bread	and	wine	to	be changed	at	the	Consecration;	(2)	The	Consecration,	at	which	the	substance	of	the bread	and	wine	are	changed	into	the	substance	of	Christ's	body	and	blood;	(3) The	Communion,	at	which	the	priest	receives	into	his	own	body	the	Holy Eucharist	under	the	appearance	of	both	bread	and	wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	933.	At	what	part	of	the	Mass	does	the	Offertory	take	place,	and	what	parts	of the	Mass	are	said	before	it?	A.	The	Offertory	takes	place	immediately	after	the uncovering	of	the	chalice.	The	parts	of	the	Mass	said	before	it	are:	The	Introit, Kyrie,	Gloria,	Prayers,	Epistle,	Gospel	and	Creed.	The	Introit,	Prayers,	Epistle and	Gospel	change	in	each	Mass	to	correspond	with	the	feast	celebrated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	934.	What	is	the	part	of	the	Mass	called	in	which	the	Words	of	Consecration are	found?	A.	The	part	of	the	Mass	in	which	the	words	of	Consecration	are found	is	called	the	Canon.	This	is	the	most	solemn	part	of	the	Mass,	and	is	rarely and	but	slightly	changed	in	any	Mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	935.	What	follows	the	Communion	of	the	Mass?	A.	Following	the Communion	of	Mass,	there	are	prayers	of	thanksgiving,	the	blessing	of	the people,	and	the	saying	of	the	last	Gospel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	936.	What	things	are	necessary	for	Mass?	A.	The	things	necessary	for	Mass are:	(1)	An	altar	with	linen	covers,	candles,	crucifix,	altar	stone	and	Mass	book; (2)	A	Chalice	with	all	needed	in	its	use,	and	bread	of	flour	from	wheat	and	wine from	the	grape;	(3)	Vestments	for	the	priest,	and	(4)	An	acolyte	or	server. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	937.	What	is	the	altar	stone,	and	of	what	does	it	remind	us?	A.	The	altar	stone is	that	part	of	the	altar	upon	which	the	priest	rests	the	Chalice	during	Mass.	This stone	contains	some	holy	relics	sealed	up	in	it	by	the	bishop,	and	if	the	altar	is	of wood	this	stone	is	inserted	just	in	front	of	the	Tabernacle.	The	altar	stone reminds	us	of	the	early	history	of	the	Church,	when	the	martyrs'	tombs	were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>used	for	altars	by	the	persecuted	Christians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	938.	What	lesson	do	we	learn	from	the	practice	of	using	martyrs'	tombs	for altars?	A.	From	the	practice	of	using	martyrs'	tombs	for	altars	we	learn	the inconvenience,	sufferings	and	dangers	the	early	Christians	willingly	underwent for	the	sake	of	hearing	Mass.	Since	the	Mass	is	the	same	now	as	it	was	then,	we should	suffer	every	inconvenience	rather	than	be	absent	from	Mass	on	Sundays or	holy	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	939.	What	things	are	used	with	the	chalice	during	Mass?	A.	The	things	used with	the	chalice	during	Mass	are:	(1)	The	purificator	or	cloth	for	wiping	the inside;	(2)	The	paten	or	small	silver	plate	used	in	handling	the	host;	(3)	The	pall or	white	card	used	for	covering	the	chalice	at	Mass;	(4)	The	corporal	or	linen cloth	on	which	the	chalice	and	host	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	940.	What	is	the	host?	A.	The	host	is	the	name	given	to	the	thin	wafer	of bread	used	at	Mass.	This	name	is	generally	applied	before	and	after Consecration	to	the	large	particle	of	bread	used	by	the	priest,	though	the	small particles	given	to	the	people	are	also	called	by	the	same	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	941.	Are	large	and	small	hosts	consecrated	at	every	Mass?	A.	A	large	host	is consecrated	at	every	Mass,	but	small	hosts	are	consecrated	only	at	some	Masses at	which	they	are	to	be	given	to	the	people	or	placed	in	the	Tabernacle	for	the Holy	Communion	of	the	faithful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	942.	What	vestments	does	the	priest	use	at	Mass	and	what	do	they	signify?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	vestments	used	by	the	priest	at	Mass	are:	(1)	The	Amice,	a	white	cloth around	the	shoulders	to	signify	resistance	to	temptation;	(2)	The	Alb,	a	long white	garment	to	signify	innocence;	(3)	The	Cincture,	a	cord	about	the	waist,	to signify	chastity;	(4)	The	Maniple	or	hanging	vestment	on	the	left	arm,	to	signify penance;	(5)	The	Stole	or	long	vestment	about	the	neck,	to	signify	immortality; (6)	The	Chasuble	or	long	vestment	over	all,	to	signify	love	and	remind	the	priest, by	its	cross	on	front	and	back,	of	the	Passion	of	Our	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	943.	How	many	colors	of	vestments	are	used,	and	what	do	the	colors	signify? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Five	colors	of	vestments	are	used,	namely,	white,	red,	green,	violet	or	purple, and	black.	White	signifies	innocence	and	is	used	on	the	feasts	of	Our	Blessed Lord,	of	the	Blessed	Virgin,	and	of	some	saints.	Red	signifies	love,	and	is	used on	the	feasts	of	the	Holy	Ghost,	and	of	martyrs.	Green	signifies	hope,	and	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>generally	used	on	Sundays	from	Epiphany	to	Pentecost.	Violet	signifies	penance, and	is	used	in	Lent	and	Advent.	Black	signifies	sorrow,	and	is	used	on	Good Friday	and	at	Masses	for	the	dead.	Gold	is	often	used	for	white	on	great	feasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	944.	What	is	the	Tabernacle	and	what	is	the	Ciborium?	A.	The	Tabernacle	is the	house-shaped	part	of	the	altar	where	the	sacred	vessels	containing	the Blessed	Sacrament	are	kept.	The	Ciborium	is	the	large	silver	or	gold	vessel which	contains	the	Blessed	Sacrament	while	in	the	Tabernacle,	and	from	which the	priest	gives	Holy	Communion	to	the	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	945.	What	is	the	Ostensorium	or	Monstrance?	A.	The	Ostensorium	or Monstrance	is	the	beautiful	wheel-like	vessel	in	which	the	Blessed	Sacrament	is exposed	and	kept	during	the	Benediction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	946.	{269}	How	should	we	assist	at	Mass?	A.	We	should	assist	at	Mass	with great	interior	recollection	and	piety	and	with	every	outward	mark	of	respect	and devotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	947.	{270}	Which	is	the	best	manner	of	hearing	Mass?	A.	The	best	manner	of hearing	Mass	is	to	offer	it	to	God	with	the	priest	for	the	same	purpose	for	which it	is	said,	to	meditate	on	Christ's	sufferings	and	death,	and	to	go	to	Holy Communion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	948.	What	is	important	for	the	proper	and	respectful	hearing	of	Mass?	A.	For the	proper	and	respectful	hearing	of	Mass	it	is	important	to	be	in	our	place before	the	priest	comes	to	the	altar	and	not	to	leave	it	before	the	priest	leaves	the altar.	Thus	we	prevent	the	confusion	and	distraction	caused	by	late	coming	and too	early	leaving.	Standing	in	the	doorways,	blocking	up	passages	and	disputing about	places	should,	out	of	respect	for	the	Holy	Sacrifice,	be	most	carefully avoided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	949.	What	is	Benediction	of	the	Blessed	Sacrament,	and	what	vestments	are used	at	it?	A.	Benediction	of	the	Blessed	Sacrament	is	an	act	of	divine	worship in	which	the	Blessed	Sacrament,	placed	in	the	ostensorium,	is	exposed	for	the adoration	of	the	people	and	is	lifted	up	to	bless	them.	The	vestments	used	at Benediction	are:	A	cope	or	large	silk	cloak	and	a	humeral	or	shoulder	veil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	950.	Why	does	the	priest	wear	special	vestments	and	use	certain	ceremonies while	performing	his	sacred	duties?	A.	The	priest	wears	special	vestments	and uses	certain	ceremonies	while	performing	his	sacred	duties:	(1)	To	give	greater</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>solemnity	and	to	command	more	attention	and	respect	at	divine	worship;	(2)	To instruct	the	people	in	the	things	that	these	vestments	and	ceremonies	signify;	(3) To	remind	the	priest	himself	of	the	importance	and	sacred	character	of	the	work in	which	he	is	the	representative	of	Our	Lord	Himself.	Hence	we	should	learn the	meaning	of	the	ceremonies	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	951.	How	do	we	show	that	the	ceremonies	of	the	Church	are	reasonable	and proper?	A.	We	show	that	the	ceremonies	of	the	Church	are	reasonable	and proper	from	the	fact	that	all	persons	in	authority,	rulers,	judges	and	masters, require	certain	acts	of	respect	from	their	subjects,	and	as	we	know	Our	Lord	is present	on	the	altar,	the	Church	requires	definite	acts	of	reverence	and	respect	at the	services	held	in	His	honor	and	in	His	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	952.	Are	there	other	reasons	for	the	use	of	ceremonies?	A.	There	are	other reasons	for	the	use	of	ceremonies:	(1)	God	commanded	ceremonies	to	be	used	in the	old	law,	and	(2)	Our	Blessed	Lord	Himself	made	use	of	ceremonies	in performing	some	of	His	miracles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	953.	How	are	the	persons	who	take	part	in	a	Solemn	Mass	or	Vespers	named? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	persons	who	take	part	in	a	Solemn	Mass	or	Vespers	are	named	as follows:	The	priest	who	says	or	celebrates	the	Mass	is	called	the	celebrant;	those who	assist	him	as	deacon	and	sub-deacon	are	called	the	ministers;	those	who serve	are	called	acolytes,	and	the	one	who	directs	the	ceremonies	is	called	the master	of	ceremonies.	If	the	celebrant	be	a	bishop,	the	Mass	or	Vespers	is	called Pontifical	Mass	or	Pontifical	Vespers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	954.	What	is	Vespers? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Vespers	is	a	portion	of	the	divine	office	or	daily	prayer	of	the Church.	It	is	sung	in	Churches	generally	on	Sunday	afternoon	or	evening, and	is	usually	followed	by	Benediction	of	the	Blessed	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	955.	Can	one	satisfy	for	neglecting	Mass	on	Sunday	by	hearing	Vespers	on the	same	day?	A.	One	cannot	satisfy	for	neglecting	Mass	on	Sunday	by	hearing Vespers	on	the	same	day,	because	there	is	no	law	of	the	Church	obliging	us under	pain	of	sin	to	attend	Vespers,	while	there	is	a	law	obliging	us	under	pain	of mortal	sin	to	hear	Mass. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HOLY	ORDERS. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	956.	{271}	What	is	the	Sacrament	of	Extreme	Unction?	A.	Extreme	Unction is	the	Sacrament	which,	through	the	anointing	and	prayer	of	the	priest,	gives health	and	strength	to	the	soul,	and	sometimes	to	the	body,	when	we	are	in danger	of	death	from	sickness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	957.	Why	is	this	Sacrament	called	Extreme	Unction?	A.	Extreme	means	last, and	Unction	means	an	anointing	or	rubbing	with	oil,	and	because	Catholics	are anointed	with	oil	at	Baptism,	Confirmation	and	Holy	Orders,	the	last	Sacrament in,	which	oil	is	used	is	called	Extreme	Unction,	or	the	last	Unction	or	anointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	958.	Is	this	Sacrament	called	Extreme	Unction	if	the	person	recovers	after receiving	it?	A.	This	Sacrament	is	always	called	Extreme	Unction,	even	if	it must	be	given	several	times	to	the	same	person,	for	Extreme	Unction	is	the proper	name	of	the	Sacrament,	and	it	may	be	given	as	often	as	a	person recovering	from	one	attack	of	sickness	is	in	danger	of	death	by	another.	In	a lingering	illness	it	may	be	repeated	after	a	month	or	six	weeks,	if	the	person slightly	recovers	and	again	relapses	into	a	dangerous	condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	959.	To	whom	may	Extreme	Unction	be	given?	A.	Extreme	Unction	may	be given	to	all	Christians	dangerously	ill,	who	have	ever	been	capable	of committing	sin	after	baptism	and	who	have	the	right	dispositions	for	the Sacrament.	Hence	it	is	never	given	to	children	who	have	not	reached	the	use	of reason,	nor	to	persons	who	have	always	been	insane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	960.	What	are	the	right	dispositions	for	Extreme	Unction?	A.	The	right dispositions	for	Extreme	Unction	are:	(1)	Resignation	to	the	Will	of	God	with regard	to	our	recovery;	(2)	A	state	of	grace	or	at	least	contrition	for	sins committed,	and	(3)	A	general	intention	or	desire	to	receive	the	Sacrament.	This Sacrament	is	never	given	to	heretics	in	danger	of	death,	because	they	cannot	be supposed	to	have	the	intention	necessary	for	receiving	it,	nor	the	desire	to	make use	of	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	in	putting	themselves	in	a	state	of	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	961.	When	and	by	whom	was	Extreme	Unction	instituted?	A.	Extreme Unction	was	instituted	at	the	time	of	the	apostles,	for	James	the	Apostle	exhorts the	sick	to	receive	it.	It	was	instituted	by	Our	Lord	Himself—though	we	do	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>know	at	what	particular	time—for	He	alone	can	make	a	visible	act	a	means	of grace,	and	the	apostles	and	their	successors	could	never	have	believed	Extreme Unction	a	Sacrament	and	used	it	as	such	unless	they	had	Our	Lord's	authority	for so	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	962.	{272}	When	should	we	receive	Extreme	Unction?	A.	We	should	receive Extreme	Unction	when	we	are	in	danger	of	death	from	sickness,	or	from	a wound	or	accident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	963.	What	parts	of	the	body	are	anointed	in	Extreme	Unction?	A.	The	parts	of the	body	anointed	in	Extreme	Unction	are:	The	eyes,	the	ears,	the	nose	or nostrils,	the	lips,	the	hands	and	the	feet,	because	these	represent	our	senses	of sight,	hearing,	smell,	taste	and	touch,	which	are	the	means	through	which	we have	committed	most	of	our	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	964.	What	things	should	be	prepared	in	the	sick-room	when	the	priest	is coming	to	give	the	last	Sacraments?	A.	When	the	priest	is	coming	to	give	the	last Sacraments,	the	following	things	should	be	prepared:	A	table	covered	with	a white	cloth;	a	crucifix;	two	lighted	candles	in	candlesticks;	holy	water	in	a	small vessel,	with	a	small	piece	of	palm	for	a	sprinkler;	a	glass	of	clean	water;	a tablespoon	and	a	napkin	or	cloth,	to	be	placed	under	the	chin	of	the	one receiving	the	Viaticum.	Besides	these,	if	Extreme	Unction	also	is	to	be	given, there	should	be	some	cotton	and	a	small	piece	of	bread	or	lemon	to	purify	the priest's	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	965.	What	seems	most	proper	with	regard	to	the	things	necessary	for the	last	Sacraments? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	It	seems	most	proper	that	the	things	necessary	for	the	last Sacraments	should	be	carefully	kept	in	every	Catholic	family,	and	should never,	if	possible,	be	used	for	any	other	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	966.	What	else	is	to	be	observed	about	the	preparation	for	the	administration of	the	last	Sacraments?	A.	The	further	preparation	for	the	administration	of	the last	Sacraments	requires	that	out	of	respect	for	the	Sacraments,	and	in	particular for	the	presence	of	Our	Lord,	everything	about	the	sick-room,	the	sick	person and	even	the	attendants,	should	be	made	as	neat	and	clean	as	possible.	Especially should	the	face,	hands	and	feet	of	the	one	to	be	anointed	be	thoroughly	clean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	967.	{273}	Should	we	wait	until	we	are	in	extreme	danger	before	we</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>receive	Extreme	Unction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	should	not	wait	until	we	are	in	extreme	danger	before	we	receive Extreme	Unction,	but	if	possible	we	should	receive	it	whilst	we	have	the use	of	our	senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	968.	What	should	we	do	in	case	of	serious	illness	if	the	sick	person	will	not consent	or	is	afraid	to	receive	the	Sacraments,	or,	at	least,	wishes	to	put	off	their reception?	A.	In	case	of	serious	illness,	if	the	sick	person	will	not	consent,	or	is afraid	to	receive	the	Sacraments,	or,	at	least,	wishes	to	put	off	their	reception,	we should	send	for	the	priest	at	once	and	let	him	do	what	he	thinks	best	in	the	case, and	thus	we	will	free	ourselves	from	the	responsibility	of	letting	a	Catholic	die without	the	last	Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	969.	{274}	Which	are	the	effects	of	the	Sacrament	of	Extreme	Unction?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	effects	of	Extreme	Unction	are:	1st,	To	comfort	us	in	the	pains	of	sickness and	to	strengthen	us	against	temptations;	2d,	To	remit	venial	sins	and	to	cleanse our	soul	from	the	remains	of	sin;	3d,	To	restore	us	to	health,	when	God	sees	fit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	970.	Will	Extreme	Unction	take	away	mortal	sin	if	the	dying	person	is	no longer	able	to	confess?	A.	Extreme	Unction	will	take	away	mortal	sin	if	the dying	person	is	no	longer	able	to	confess,	provided	he	has	the	sorrow	for	his	sins that	would	be	necessary	for	the	worthy	reception	of	the	Sacrament	of	Penance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	971.	How	do	we	know	that	this	Sacrament,	more	than	any	other,	was instituted	to	benefit	the	body?	A.	We	know	that	this	Sacrament	more	than	any other	was	instituted	to	benefit	the	body	(1)	From	the	words	of	St.	James exhorting	us	to	receive	it;	(2)	It	is	given	when	the	soul	is	already	purified	by	the graces	of	Penance	and	Holy	Viaticum;	(3)	One	of	its	chief	objects	is	to	restore	us to	health	if	it	be	for	our	spiritual	good,	as	most	of	the	prayers	said	in	giving	this Sacrament	indicate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	972.	Since	Extreme	Unction	may	restore	us	to	health,	should	we	not	be	glad to	receive	it?	A.	Since	Extreme	Unction	may	restore	us	to	health,	we	should	be glad	to	receive	it,	and	we	should	not	delay	its	reception	till	we	are	so	near	death that	God	could	restore	us	only	by	a	miracle.	Again,	this	Sacrament,	like	the others,	gives	sanctifying	and	sacramental	grace,	which	we	should	be	eager	to obtain	as	soon	as	our	sickness	is	sufficient	to	give	us	the	privilege	of	receiving the	last	Sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>Q.	973.	{275}	What	do	you	mean	by	the	remains	of	sin?	A.	By	the	remains	of sin	I	mean	the	inclination	to	evil	and	the	weakness	of	the	will	which	are	the result	of	our	sins,	and	which	remain	after	our	sins	have	been	forgiven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	974.	{276}	How	should	we	receive	the	Sacrament	of	Extreme	Unction?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	should	receive	the	Sacrament	of	Extreme	Unction	in	the	state	of	grace,	and with	lively	faith	and	resignation	to	the	will	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	975.	{277}	Who	is	the	minister	of	the	Sacrament	of	Extreme	Unction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	priest	is	the	minister	of	the	Sacrament	of	Extreme	Unction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	976.	What	is	the	final	preparation	we	should	make	for	the	reception	of	the	last Sacraments?	A.	The	final	preparation	we	should	make	for	the	reception	of	the last	Sacraments	consists	in	an	earnest	effort	to	be	resigned	to	God's	Holy	Will,	to excite	ourselves	to	true	sorrow	for	our	sins,	to	profit	by	the	graces	given	us,	to keep	worldly	thoughts	from	the	mind,	and	to	dispose	ourselves	as	best	we	can for	the	worthy	reception	of	the	Sacraments	and	the	blessings	of	a	good	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	977.	At	what	time	should	persons	dangerously	ill	attend	to	the	final arrangement	of	their	temporal	or	worldly	affairs?	A.	Persons	dangerously	ill should	attend	to	the	final	arrangement	of	their	temporal	or	worldly	affairs	at	the very	beginning	of	their	illness,	that	these	things	may	not	distract	them	at	the	hour of	death,	and	that	they	may	give	the	last	hours	of	their	life	entirely	to	the	care	of their	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	978.	{278}	What	is	the	Sacrament	of	Holy	Orders?	A.	Holy	Orders	is	a Sacrament	by	which	bishops,	priests,	and	other	ministers	of	the	Church	are ordained	and	receive	the	power	and	grace	to	perform	their	sacred	duties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	979.	Besides	bishops	and	priests,	who	are	the	other	ministers	of	the	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Besides	bishops	and	priests,	the	other	ministers	of	the	Church	are	deacons and	sub-deacons,	who,	while	preparing	for	the	priesthood,	have	received	some	of the	Holy	Orders,	but	who	have	not	been	ordained	to	the	full	powers	of	the	priest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	980.	Why	is	this	Sacrament	called	Holy	Orders?	A.	This	Sacrament	is	called Holy	Orders	because	it	is	conferred	by	seven	different	grades	or	steps	following one	another	in	fixed	order	by	which	the	sacred	powers	of	the	priesthood	are gradually	given	to	the	one	admitted	to	that	holy	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	981.	What	are	the	grades	by	which	one	ascends	to	the	priesthood?	A.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>grades	by	which	one	ascends	to	the	priesthood	are	(1)	Tonsure,	or	the	clipping	of the	hair	by	the	bishop,	by	which	the	candidate	for	priesthood	dedicates	himself to	the	service	of	the	altar;	(2)	The	four	minor	orders,	Porter,	Reader,	Exorcist, and	Acolyte,	by	which	he	is	permitted	to	perform	certain	duties	that	laymen should	not	perform;	(3)	Sub-deaconship,	by	which	he	takes	upon	himself	the obligation	of	leading	a	life	of	perpetual	chastity	and	of	saying	daily	the	divine office;	(4)	Deaconship,	by	which	he	receives	power	to	preach,	baptize,	and	give Holy	Communion.	The	next	step,	priesthood,	gives	him	power	to	offer	the	Holy Sacrifice	of	the	Mass	and	forgive	sins.	These	orders	are	not	all	given	at	once,	but at	times	fixed	by	the	laws	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	982.	Are	not	the	different	orders	separate	Sacraments?	A.	These	different orders	are	not	separate	Sacraments.	Taken	all	together,	some	are	a	preparation for	the	Sacrament	and	the	rest	are	but	the	one	Sacrament	of	Holy	Orders;	as	the roots,	trunk	and	branches	form	but	one	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	983.	What	name	is	given	to	sub-deaconship,	deaconship	and	priesthood?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sub-deaconship,	deaconship	and	priesthood	are	called	major	or	greater	orders, because	those	who	receive	them	are	bound	for	life	to	the	service	of	the	altar	and they	cannot	return	to	the	service	of	the	world	to	live	as	ordinary	laymen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	984.	What	double	power	does	the	Church	possess	and	confer	on	her	pastors? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Church	possesses	and	confers	on	her	pastor,	the	power	of	orders	and	the power	of	jurisdiction;	that	is,	the	power	to	administer	the	Sacraments	and sanctify	the	faithful,	and	the	power	to	teach	and	make	laws	that	direct	the faithful	to	their	spiritual	good.	A	bishop	has	the	full	power	of	orders	and	the Pope	alone	has	the	full	power	of	jurisdiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	985.	How	do	the	pastors	of	the	Church	rank	according	to	authority?	A.	The pastors	of	the	Church	rank	according	to	authority	as	follows:	(1)	Priests,	who govern	parishes	or	congregations	in	the	name	of	their	bishop;	(2)	Bishops,	who rule	over	a	number	of	parishes	or	a	diocese;	(3)	Archbishops,	who	have	authority over	a	number	of	dioceses	or	a	province;	(4)	Primates,	who	have	authority	over the	ecclesiastical	or	Church	provinces	of	a	nation;	(5)	Patriarchs,	who	have authority	over	a	whole	country;	and	last	and	highest,	the	Pope,	who	rules	the Church	throughout	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	986.	How	do	the	prelates	or	higher	officers	of	the	Church	rank	in	dignity?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	prelates	or	higher	officers	of	the	Church	rank	in	dignity	as	they	rank	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>authority,	except	that	in	dignity	Cardinals	are	next	to	the	Pope,	and	Vicars Apostolic,	Monsignori,	and	others	having	titles	follow	bishops.	Papal	delegates and	those	specially	appointed	by	the	Pope	rank	according	to	the	powers	he	has given	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	987.	Who	are	Cardinals,	what	are	their	duties	and	how	are	they	divided?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cardinals	are	the	members	of	the	Supreme	Council	or	Senate	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	duties	are	to	advise	and	aid	the	Pope	in	the	government	of	the	Church,	and to	elect	a	new	Pope	when	the	reigning	Pope	dies.	They	are	divided	into committees	called	sacred	congregations,	each	having,	its	special	work	to perform.	All	these	congregations	taken	together	are	called	the	Sacred	College	of Cardinals,	of	which	the	whole	number	is	seventy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	988.	Who	is	a	Monsignor?	A.	A	Monsignor	is	a	worthy	priest	upon	whom	the Pope	confers	this	title	as	a	mark	of	esteem.	It	gives	certain	privileges	and	the right	to	wear	purple	like	a	bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	989.	Who	is	a	Vicar-General?	A.	A	Vicar-General	is	one	who	is	appointed	by the	bishop	to	aid	him	in	the	government	of	his	diocese.	He	shares	the	bishop's power	and	in	the	bishop's	absence	he	acts	for	the	bishop	and	with	his	authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	990.	Who	is	an	Abbot?	A.	An	Abbot	is	one	who	exercises	over	a	religious community	of	men	authority	similar	in	many	things	to	that	exercised	by	a	bishop over	his	diocese.	He	has	also	certain	privileges	usually	granted	to	bishops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	991.	What	is	the	pallium?	A.	The	pallium	is	a	white	woolen	vestment	worn by	the	Pope	and	sent	by	him	to	patriarchs,	primates	and	archbishops.	It	is	the symbol	of	the	fullness	of	pastoral	power,	and	reminds	the	wearer	of	the	Good Shepherd,	whose	example	he	must	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	992.	{279}	What	is	necessary	to	receive	Holy	Orders	worthily?	A.	To	receive Holy	Orders	worthily	it	is	necessary	to	be	in	the	state	of	grace,	to	have	the necessary	knowledge	and	a	divine	call	to	this	sacred	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	993.	What	name	is	given	to	this	divine	call	and	how	can	we	discover	this call?	A.	This	divine	call	is	named	a	vocation	to	the	priestly	or	religious	life.	We can	discover	it	in	our	constant	inclination	to	such	a	life	from	the	pure	and	holy motive	of	serving	God	better	in	it,	together	with	our	fitness	for	it,	or,	at	least,	our ability	to	prepare	for	it,	also	in	our	true	piety	and	mastery	over	our	sinful passions	and	unlawful	desires. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>Q.	994.	How	should	we	finally	determine	our	vocation?	A.	We	should	finally determine	our	vocation:	(1)	By	leading	a	holy	life	that	we	may	be	more	worthy of	it;	(2)	By	praying	to	the	Holy	Ghost	for	light	on	the	subject;	(3)	By	seeking the	advice	of	holy	and	prudent	persons	and	above	all	of	our	confessor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	995.	What	should	parents	and	guardians	bear	in	mind	with	regard	to	their children's	vocations?	A.	Parents	and	guardians	should	bear	in	mind	with	regard to	their	children's	vocations:	(1)	That	it	is	their	duty	to	aid	their	children	to discover	their	vocation;	(2)	That	it	is	sinful	for	them	to	resist	the	Will	of	God	by endeavoring	to	turn	their	children	from	their	true	vocation	or	to	prevent	them from	following	it	by	placing	obstacles	in	their	way,	and,	worst	of	all,	to	urge them	to	enter	a	state	of	life	to	which	they	have	not	been	divinely	called;	(3)	That in	giving	their	advice	they	should	be	guided	only	by	the	future	good	and happiness	of	their	children	and	not	by	any	selfish	or	worldly	motive	which	may lead	to	the	loss	of	souls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	996.	{280}	How	should	Christians	look	upon	the	priests	of	the	Church?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christians	should	look	upon	the	priests	of	the	Church	as	the	messengers	of	God and	the	dispensers	of	His	mysteries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	997.	How	do	we	know	that	the	priests	of	the	Church	are	the	messengers	of God?	A.	We	know	that	the	priests	of	the	Church	are	the	messengers	of	God, because	Christ	said	to	His	apostles,	and	through	them	to	their	successors:	"As the	Father	hath	sent	Me,	I	also	send	you";	that	is	to	say,	to	preach	the	true religion,	to	administer	the	Sacraments,	to	offer	Sacrifice,	and	to	do	all	manner	of good	for	the	salvation	of	souls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	998.	When	did	the	priests	of	the	Church	receive	this	threefold	power	to preach,	to	forgive	sins	and	to	consecrate	bread	and	wine?	A.	The	priests	of	the Church	received	this	three-fold	power	to	preach,	to	forgive	sins	and	to consecrate	bread	and	wine,	when	Christ	said	to	them,	through	the	apostles:	"Go teach	all	nations";	"Whose	sins	you	shall	forgive	they	are	forgiven,"	and	"Do	this for	a	commemoration	of	Me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	999.	Why	should	we	show	great	respect	to	the	priests	and	bishops	of	the Church?	A.	We	should	show	great	respect	to	the	priests	and	bishops	of	the Church:	(1)	Because	they	are	the	representatives	of	Christ	upon	earth,	and	(2) Because	they	administer	the	Sacraments	without	which	we	cannot	be	saved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,	we	should	be	most	careful	in	what	we	do,	say	or	think	concerning</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>God's	ministers.	To	show	our	respect	in	proportion	to	their	dignity,	we	address the	priest	as	Reverend,	the	bishop	as	Right	Reverend,	the	archbishop	as	Most Reverend,	and	the	Pope	as	Holy	Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1000.	Should	we	do	more	than	merely	respect	the	ministers	of	God?	A.	We should	do	more	than	merely	respect	the	ministers	of	God.	We	should	earnestly and	frequently	pray	for	them,	that	they	may	be	enabled	to	perform	the	difficult and	important	duties	of	their	holy	state	in	a	manner	pleasing	to	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1001.	{281}	Who	can	confer	the	Sacrament	of	Holy	Orders? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Bishops	can	confer	the	Sacrament	of	Holy	Orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1002.	How	do	we	know	that	there	is	a	true	priesthood	in	the	Church?	A.	We know	that	there	is	a	true	priesthood	in	the	Church:	(1)	Because	in	the	Jewish religion,	which	was	only	a	figure	of	the	Christian	religion,	there	was	a	true priesthood	established	by	God;	(2)	Because	Christ	conferred	on	His	apostles	and not	on	all	the	faithful	the	power	to	offer	Sacrifice,	distribute	the	Holy	Eucharist and	forgive	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1003.	But	is	there	need	of	a	special	Sacrament	of	Holy	Orders	to	confer	these powers?	A.	There	is	need	of	a	special	Sacrament	of	Holy	Orders	to	confer	these powers:	(1)	Because	the	priesthood	which	is	to	continue	the	work	of	the	apostles must	be	visible	in	the	Church,	and	it	must	therefore	be	conferred	by	some	visible ceremony	or	outward	sign;	(2)	because	this	outward	sign	called	Holy	Orders gives	not	only	power	but	grace	and	was	instituted	by	Christ,	Holy	Orders	must be	a	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1004.	Can	bishops,	priests	and	other	ministers	of	the	Church	always	exercise the	power	they	have	received	in	Holy	Orders?	A.	Bishops,	priests	and	other ministers	of	the	Church	cannot	exercise	the	power	they	have	received	in	Holy Orders	unless	authorized	and	sent	to	do	so	by	their	lawful	superiors.	The	power can	never	be	taken	from	them,	but	the	right	to	use	it	may	be	withdrawn	for causes	laid	down	in	the	laws	of	the	Church,	or	for	reasons	that	seem	good	to those	in	authority	over	them.	Any	use	of	sacred	power	without	authority	is sinful,	and	all	who	take	part	in	such	ceremonies	are	guilty	of	sin. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>Q.	1005.	{282}	What	is	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony?	A.	The	Sacrament	of Matrimony	is	the	Sacrament	which	unites	a	Christian	man	and	woman	in	lawful marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1006.	When	are	persons	lawfully	married? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Persons	are	lawfully	married	when	they	comply	with	all	the	laws	of God	and	of	the	Church	relating	to	marriage.	To	marry	unlawfully	is	a mortal	sin,	and	it	deprives	the	souls	of	the	grace	of	the	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1007.	When	was	marriage	first	instituted? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Marriage	was	first	instituted	in	the	Garden	of	Eden,	when	God	created Adam	and	Eve	and	made	them	husband	and	wife,	but	it	was	not	then	a Sacrament,	for	their	union	did	not	confer	any	special	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1008.	When	was	the	contract	of	marriage	raised	to	the	dignity	of	a Sacrament?	A.	The	exact	time	at	which	the	contract	of	marriages	was	raised	to the	dignity	of	a	Sacrament	is	not	known,	but	the	fact	that	it	was	thus	raised	is certain	from	passages	in	the	New	Testament	and	from	the	constant	teaching	of the	Church	ever	since	the	time	of	the	apostles.	Our	Lord	did	not	merely	add grace	to	the	contract,	but	He	made	the	very	contract	a	Sacrament,	so	that Christians	cannot	make	this	contract	without	receiving	the	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1009.	What	is	the	outward	sign	in	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony,	and	in	what does	the	whole	essence	of	the	marriage	contract	consist?	A.	The	outward	sign	in the	Sacrament	of	matrimony	is	the	mutual	consent	of	the	persons,	expressed	by words	or	signs	in	accordance	with	the	laws	of	the	Church.	The	whole	essence	of the	marriage	contract	consists	in	the	surrender	by	the	persons	of	their	bodies	to each	other	and	in	declaring	by	word	or	sign	that	they	make	this	surrender	and take	each	other	for	husband	and	wife	now	and	for	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1010.	What	are	the	chief	ends	of	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony?	A.	The	chief ends	of	the	Sacrament	of	matrimony	are:	(1)	To	enable	the	husband	and	wife	to aid	each	other	in	securing	the	salvation	of	their	souls;	(2)	To	propagate	or	keep up	the	existence	of	the	human	race	by	bringing	children	into	the	world	to	serve God;	(3)	To	prevent	sins	against	the	holy	virtue	of	purity	by	faithfully	obeying the	laws	of	the	marriage	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1011.	{283}	Can	a	Christian	man	and	woman	be	united	in	lawful	marriage	in any	other	way	than	by	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony?	A.	A	Christian	man	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>woman	cannot	be	united	in	lawful	marriage	in	any	other	way	than	by	the Sacrament	of	Matrimony,	because	Christ	raised	marriage	to	the	dignity	of	a sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1012.	Were,	then,	all	marriages	before	the	coming	of	Christ	unlawful	and invalid?	A.	All	marriages	before	the	coming	of	Christ	were	not	unlawful	and invalid.	They	were	both	lawful	and	valid	when	the	persons	contracting	them followed	the	dictates	of	their	conscience	and	the	laws	of	God	as	they	knew	them; but	such	marriages	were	only	contracts.	Through	their	evil	inclinations	many forgot	or	neglected	the	true	character	of	marriage	till	Our	Lord	restored	it	to	its former	unity	and	purity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1013.	What	do	we	mean	by	impediments	to	marriage?	A.	By	impediments	to marriage	we	mean	certain	restrictions,	imposed	by	the	law	of	God	or	of	the Church,	that	render	the	marriage	invalid	or	unlawful	when	they	are	violated	in entering	into	it.	These	restrictions	regard	age,	health,	relationship,	intention, religion	and	other	matters	affecting	the	good	of	the	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1014.	Can	the	Church	dispense	from	or	remove	these	impediments	to marriage?	A.	The	Church	can	dispense	from	or	remove	the	impediments	to marriage	that	arise	from	its	own	laws;	but	it	cannot	dispense	from	impediments that	arise	from	the	laws	of	God	and	nature.	Every	lawmaker	can	change	or excuse	from	the	laws	made	by	himself	or	his	equals,	but	he	cannot,	of	his	own authority,	change	or	excuse	from	laws	made	by	a	higher	power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1015.	What	is	required	that	the	Church	may	grant,	when	it	is	able, dispensations	from	the	impediments	to	marriage	or	from	other	laws?	A.	That	the Church	may	grant	dispensations	from	the	impediments	to	marriage	or	from	other laws,	there	must	be	a	good	and	urgent	reason	for	granting	such	dispensations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Church	does	not	grant	dispensations	without	cause	and	merely	to	satisfy	the wishes	of	those	who	ask	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1016.	Why	does	the	Church	sometimes	require	the	persons	to	whom dispensations	are	granted	to	pay	a	tax	or	fee	for	the	privilege?	A.	The	Church sometimes	requires	the	persons	to	whom	dispensations	are	granted	to	pay	a	tax or	fee	for	the	privilege:	(1)	That	persons	on	account	of	this	tax	be	restrained from	asking	for	dispensations	and	may	comply	with	the	general	laws;	(2)	That the	Church	may	not	have	to	bear	the	expense	of	supporting	an	office	for	granting privileges	to	a	few. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>Q.	1017.	What	should	persons	who	are	about	to	get	married	do?	A.	Persons	who are	about	to	get	married	should	give	their	pastor	timely	notice	of	their	intention, make	known	to	him	privately	whatever	they	suspect	might	be	an	impediment	to the	marriage,	and	make	sure	of	all	arrangements	before	inviting	their	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1018.	What	timely	notice	of	marriage	should	be	given	to	the	priest,	and	why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	At	least	three	weeks	notice	of	marriage	should	be	given	to	the	priest,	because, according	to	the	laws	of	the	Church,	the	names	of	the	persons	about	to	get married	must	be	announced	and	their	intended	marriage	published	at	the principal	Mass	in	their	parish	for	three	successive	Sundays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1019.	Why	are	the	banns	of	matrimony	published	in	the	Church?	A.	The banns	of	matrimony	are	published	in	the	Church	that	any	person	who	might know	of	any	impediment	to	the	marriage	may	have	an	opportunity	to	declare	it privately	to	the	priest	before	the	marriage	takes	place	and	thus	prevent	an	invalid or	unlawful	marriage.	Persons	who	know	of	such	impediments	and	fail	to declare	them	in	due	time	are	guilty	of	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1020.	What	things	in	particular	should	persons	arranging	for	their	marriage make	known	to	the	priest?	A.	Persons	arranging	for	their	marriage	should	make known	to	the	priest	whether	both	are	Christians	and	Catholics;	whether	either has	been	solemnly	engaged	to	another	person;	whether	they	have	ever	made	any vow	to	God	with	regard	to	chastity	or	the	like;	whether	they	are	related	and	in what	degree;	whether	either	was	ever	married	to	any	member	of	the	other's family	and	whether	either	was	ever	godparent	in	baptism	for	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1021.	What	else	must	they	make	known?	A.	They	must	also	make	known whether	either	was	married	before	and	what	proof	can	be	given	of	the	death	of the	former	husband	or	wife;	whether	they	really	intend	to	get	married,	and	do	so of	their	own	will;	whether	they	are	of	lawful	age;	whether	they	are	sound	in body	or	suffering	from	any	deformity	that	might	prevent	their	marriage,	and lastly,	whether	they	live	in	the	parish	in	which	they	ask	to	be	married,	and	if	so, how	long	they	have	lived	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1022.	What	is	particularly	necessary	that	persons	may	do	their	duty	in	the marriage	state?	A.	That	persons	may	do	their	duty	in	the	marriage	state,	it	is particularly	necessary	that	they	should	be	well	instructed,	before	entering	it,	in the	truths	and	duties	of	their	religion	for	how	will	they	teach	their	children	these things	if	they	are	ignorant	of	them	themselves? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>Q.	1023.	{284}	Can	the	bond	of	Christian	marriage	be	dissolved	by	any human	power? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	bond	of	Christian	marriage	cannot	be	dissolved	by	any	human power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1024.	Does	not	a	divorce	granted	by	courts	of	justice	break	the	bond	of marriage?	A.	Divorce	granted	by	courts	of	justice	or	by	any	human	power	does not	break	the	bond	of	marriage,	and	one	who	makes	use	of	such	a	divorce	to marry	again	while	the	former	husband	or	wife	lives	commits	a	sacrilege	and lives	in	the	sin	of	adultery.	A	civil	divorce	may	give	a	sufficient	reason	for	the persons	to	live	apart	and	it	may	determine	their	rights	with	regard	to	support,	the control	of	the	children	and	other	temporal	things,	but	it	has	no	effect	whatever upon	the	bond	and	spiritual	nature	of	the	Sacrament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1025.	Does	not	the	Church	sometimes	allow	husband	and	wife	to	separate and	live	apart?	A.	The	Church	sometimes,	for	very	good	reasons,	does	allow husband	and	wife	to	separate	and	live	apart;	but	that	is	not	dissolving	the	bond	of marriage,	or	divorce	as	it	is	called,	for	though	separated	they	are	still	husband and	wife,	and	neither	can	marry	again	till	the	other	dies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1026.	Has	not	the	Church	sometimes	allowed	Catholics	once	married	to separate	and	marry	again?	A.	The	Church	has	never	allowed	Catholics	once really	married	to	separate	and	marry	again,	but	it	has	sometimes	declared persons	apparently	married	free	to	marry	again,	because	their	first	marriage	was null;	that	is,	no	marriage	on	account	of	some	impediment	not	discovered	till	after the	ceremony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1027.	What	evils	follow	divorce	so	commonly	claimed	by	those	outside	the true	Church	and	granted	by	civil	authority?	A.	The	evils	that	follow	divorce	so commonly	claimed	by	those	outside	the	true	Church	and	granted	by	civil authority	are	very	many;	but	chiefly	(1)	A	disregard	for	the	sacred	character	of the	Sacrament	and	for	the	spiritual	welfare	of	the	children;	(2)	The	loss	of	the true	idea	of	home	and	family	followed	by	bad	morals	and	sinful	living. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1028.	{285}	Which	are	the	effects	of	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony?	A.	The effects	of	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony	are	1st,	To	sanctify	the	love	of	husband and	wife;	2nd,	To	give	them	grace	to	bear	with	each	other's	weaknesses;	3d,	To enable	them	to	bring	up	their	children	in	the	fear	and	love	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>Q.	1029.	What	do	we	mean	by	bearing	with	each	other's	weaknesses?	A.	By bearing	with	each	other's	weaknesses	we	mean	that	the	husband	and	wife	must be	patient	with	each	other's	faults,	bad	habits	or	dispositions,	pardon	them	easily, and	aid	each	other	in	overcoming	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1030.	How	are	parents	specially	fitted	to	bring	up	their	children	in	the	fear and	love	of	God?	A.	Parents	are	specially	fitted	to	bring	up	their	children	in	the fear	and	love	of	God	(1)	By	the	special	grace	they	receive	to	advise	and	direct their	children	and	to	warn	them	against	evil;	(2)	By	the	experience	they	have acquired	in	passing	through	life	from	childhood	to	the	position	of	parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Children	should,	therefore,	conscientiously	seek	and	accept	the	direction	of	good parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1031.	{286}	To	receive	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony	worthily	is	it	necessary to	be	in	the	state	of	grace?	A.	To	receive	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony	worthily	it is	necessary	to	be	in	the	state	of	grace,	and	it	is	necessary	also	to	comply	with the	laws	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1032.	With	what	laws	of	the	Church	are	we	bound	to	comply	in	receiving	the Sacrament	of	Matrimony?	A.	In	receiving	the	Sacrament	of	matrimony	we	are bound	to	comply	with	whatever	laws	of	the	Church	concern	Matrimony;	such	as laws	forbidding	solemn	marriage	in	Lent	and	Advent;	or	marriage	with	relatives or	with	persons	of	a	different	religion,	and	in	general	all	laws	that	refer	to	any impediment	to	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1033.	In	how	many	ways	may	persons	be	related?	A.	Persons	may	be	related in	four	ways.	When	they	are	related	by	blood	their	relationship	is	called consanguinity;	when	they	are	related	by	marriage	it	is	called	affinity;	when	they are	related	by	being	god-parents	in	Baptism	or	Confirmation,	it	is	called	spiritual affinity;	when	they	are	related	by	adoption,	it	is	called	legal	affinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1034.	{287}	Who	has	the	right	to	make	laws	concerning	the	Sacrament	of marriage?	A.	The	Church	alone	has	the	right	to	make	laws	concerning	the Sacrament	of	marriage,	though	the	state	also	has	the	right	to	make	laws concerning	the	civil	effects	of	the	marriage	contract. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1035.	What	do	we	mean	by	laws	concerning	the	civil	effects	of	the	marriage contract?	A.	By	laws	concerning	the	civil	effects	of	the	marriage	contract	we mean	laws	with	regard	to	the	property	or	debts	of	the	husband	and	wife,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>inheritance	of	their	children,	or	whatever	pertains	to	their	temporal	affairs.	All persons	are	bound	to	obey	the	laws	of	their	country	when	these	laws	are	not opposed	to	the	laws	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1036.	{288}	Does	the	Church	forbid	the	marriage	of	Catholics	with	persons who	have	a	different	religion	or	no	religion	at	all?	A.	The	Church	does	forbid	the marriage	of	Catholics	with	persons	who	have	a	different	religion	or	no	religion	at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1037.	{289}	Why	does	the	Church	forbid	the	marriage	of	Catholics	with persons	who	have	a	different	religion	or	no	religion	at	all?	A.	The	Church forbids	the	marriage	of	Catholics	with	persons	who	have	a	different	religion,	or no	religion	at	all,	because	such	marriages	generally	lead	to	indifference,	loss	of faith,	and	to	the	neglect	of	the	religious	education	of	the	children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1038.	What	are	the	marriages	of	Catholics	with	persons	of	a	different	religion called,	and	when	does	the	Church	permit	them	by	dispensation?	A.	The marriages	of	Catholics	with	persons	of	a	different	religion	are	called	mixed marriages.	The	Church	permits	them	by	dispensation	only	under	certain conditions	and	for	urgent	reasons;	chiefly	to	prevent	a	greater	evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1039.	What	are	the	conditions	upon	which	the	Church	will	permit	a	Catholic to	marry	one	who	is	not	a	Catholic?	A.	The	conditions	upon	which	the	Church will	permit	a	Catholic	to	marry	one	who	is	not	a	Catholic	are:	(1)	That	the Catholic	be	allowed	the	free	exercise	of	his	or	her	religion;	(2)	that	the	Catholic shall	try	by	teaching	and	good	example	to	lead	the	one	who	is	not	a	Catholic	to embrace	the	true	faith;	(3)	that	all	the	children	born	of	the	marriage	shall	be brought	up	in	the	Catholic	religion.	The	marriage	ceremony	must	not	be	repeated before	a	heretical	minister.	Without	these	promises,	the	Church	will	not	consent to	a	mixed	marriage,	and	if	the	Church	does	not	consent	the	marriage	is unlawful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1040.	What	penalty	does	the	Church	impose	on	Catholics	who	marry	before	a Protestant	minister?	A.	Catholics	who	marry	before	a	Protestant	minister	incur excommunication;	that	is,	a	censure	of	the	Church	or	spiritual	penalty	which prevents	them	from	receiving	the	Sacrament	of	Penance	till	the	priest	who	hears their	confession	gets	special	faculties	or	permission	from	the	bishop;	because	by such	a	marriage	they	make	profession	of	a	false	religion	in	acknowledging	as	a priest	one	who	has	neither	sacred	power	nor	authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>Q.	1041.	How	does	the	Church	show	its	displeasure	at	mixed	marriages?	A.	The Church	shows	its	displeasure	at	mixed	marriages	by	the	coldness	with	which	it sanctions	them,	prohibiting	all	religious	ceremony	at	them	by	forbidding	the priest	to	use	any	sacred	vestments,	holy	water	or	blessing	of	the	ring	at	such marriages;	by	prohibiting	them	also	from	taking	place	in	the	Church	or	even	in the	sacristy.	On	the	other	hand,	the	Church	shows	its	joy	and	approval	at	a	true Catholic	marriage	by	the	Nuptial	Mass	and	solemn	ceremonies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1042.	Why	should	Catholics	avoid	mixed	marriages?	A.	Catholics	should avoid	mixed	marriages	(1)	Because	they	are	displeasing	to	the	Church	and cannot	bring	with	them	the	full	measure	of	God's	grace	and	blessing;	(2)	because the	children	should	have	the	good	example	of	both	parents	in	the	practice	of	their religion;	(3)	because	such	marriages	give	rise	to	frequent	disputes	on	religious questions	between	husband	and	wife	and	between	their	relatives;	(4)	because	the one	not	a	Catholic,	disregarding	the	sacred	character	of	the	Sacrament,	may claim	a	divorce	and	marry	again,	leaving	the	Catholic	married	and	abandoned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1043.	Does	the	Church	seek	to	make	converts	by	its	laws	concerning	mixed marriages?	A.	The	Church	does	not	seek	to	make	converts	by	its	laws concerning	mixed	marriages,	but	seeks	only	to	keep	its	children	from	losing	their faith	and	becoming	perverts	by	constant	company	with	persons	not	Catholics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Church	does	not	wish	persons	to	become	Catholics	merely	for	the	sake	of marrying	Catholics.	Such	conversions	are,	as	a	rule,	not	sincere,	do	no	good,	but rather	make	such	converts	hypocrites	and	guilty	of	greater	sins,	especially	sins	of sacrilege. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1044.	{290}	Why	do	many	marriages	prove	unhappy?	A.	Many	marriages prove	unhappy	because	they	are	entered	into	hastily	and	without	worthy	motives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1045.	When	are	marriages	entered	into	hastily?	A.	Marriages	are	entered	into hastily	when	persons	do	not	sufficiently	consider	and	investigate	the	character, habits	and	dispositions	of	the	one	they	intend	to	marry.	It	is	wise	to	look	for lasting	qualities	and	solid	virtues	in	a	life-long	companion	and	not	to	be	carried away	with	characteristics	that	please	only	for	a	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1046.	When	are	motives	for	marriage	worthy?	A.	Motives	for	marriage	are worthy	when	persons	enter	it	for	the	sake	of	doing	God's	will	and	fulfilling	the end	for	which	He	instituted	the	Sacrament.	Whatever	is	opposed	to	the	true object	of	the	Sacrament	and	the	sanctification	of	the	husband	and	wife	must	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>an	unworthy	motive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1047.	{291}	How	should	Christians	prepare	for	a	holy	and	happy	marriage? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Christians	should	prepare	for	a	holy	and	happy	marriage	by	receiving	the Sacraments	of	Penance	and	Holy	Eucharist;	by	begging	God	to	grant	them	a pure	intention	and	to	direct	their	choice;	and	by	seeking	the	advice	of	their parents	and	the	blessing	of	their	pastors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1048.	How	may	parents	be	guilty	of	great	injustice	to	their	children	in	case	of marriage?	A.	Parents	may	be	guilty	of	great	injustice	to	their	children	in	case	of marriage	by	seeking	the	gratification	of	their	own	aims	and	desires,	rather	than the	good	of	their	children,	and	thus	for	selfish	and	unreasonable	motives	forcing their	children	to	marry	persons	they	dislike	or	preventing	them	from	marrying the	persons	chosen	by	the	dictates	of	their	conscience,	or	compelling	them	to marry	when	they	have	no	vocation	for	such	a	life	or	no	true	knowledge	of	its obligations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1049.	May	persons	receive	the	Sacrament	of	Matrimony	more	than	once?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Persons	may	receive	the	sacrament	of	Matrimony	more	than	once,	provided	they are	certain	of	the	death	of	the	former	husband	or	wife	and	comply	with	the	laws of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1050.	Where	and	at	what	time	of	the	day	should	Catholics	be	married?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Catholics	should	be	married	before	the	altar	in	the	Church.	They	should	be married	in	the	morning,	and	with	a	Nuptial	Mass	if	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1051.	What	must	never	be	forgotten	by	those	who	attend	a	marriage ceremony	in	the	Church?	A.	They	who	attend	a	marriage	ceremony	in	the Church	must	never	forget	the	presence	of	the	Blessed	Sacrament,	and	that	all laughing,	talking,	or	irreverence	is	forbidden	then	as	at	other	times.	Women	must never	enter	into	the	presence	of	the	Blessed	Sacrament	with	uncovered	heads, and	their	dress	must	be	in	keeping	with	the	strict	modesty	that	Our	Lord's presence	demands,	no	matter	what	worldly	vanity	or	social	manners	may require. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	TWENTY-SEVENTH.	ON	THE	SACRAMENTALS. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>Q.	1052.	{292}	What	is	a	sacramental?	A.	A	sacramental	is	anything	set	apart	or blessed	by	the	Church	to	excite	good	thoughts	and	to	increase	devotion,	and through	these	movements	of	the	heart	to	remit	venial	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1053.	How	do	the	Sacramentals	excite	good	thoughts	and	increase	devotion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Sacramentals	excite	good	thoughts	by	recalling	to	our	minds	some special	reason	for	doing	good	and	avoiding	evil;	especially	by	reminding	us	of some	holy	person,	event	or	thing	through	which	blessings	have	come	to	us.	They increase	devotion	by	fixing	our	minds	on	particular	virtues	and	by	helping	us	to understand	and	desire	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1054.	Do	the	Sacramentals	of	themselves	remit	venial	sins?	A.	The Sacramentals	of	themselves	do	not	remit	venial	sins,	but	they	move	us	to	truer devotion,	to	greater	love	for	God	and	greater	sorrow	for	our	sins,	and	this devotion,	love	and	sorrow	bring	us	grace,	and	the	grace	remits	venial	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1055.	Why	does	the	Church	use	Sacramentals?	A.	The	Church	uses Sacramentals	to	teach	the	faithful	of	every	class	the	truths	of	religion,	which	they may	learn	as	well	by	their	sight	as	by	their	hearing;	for	God	wishes	us	to	learn His	laws	by	every	possible	means,	by	every	power	of	soul	and	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1056.	Show	by	an	example	how	Sacramentals	aid	the	ignorant	in	learning	the truths	of	faith.	A.	Sacramentals	aid	the	ignorant	in	learning	the	truths	of	faith	as children	learn	from	pictures	before	they	are	able	to	read.	Thus	one	who	cannot read	the	account	of	Our	Lord's	passion	may	learn	it	from	the	Stations	of	the Cross,	and	one	who	kneels	before	a	crucifix	and	looks	on	the	bleeding	head, pierced	hands	and	wounded	side,	is	better	able	to	understand	Christ's	sufferings than	one	without	a	crucifix	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1057.	What	are	the	Stations	or	Way	of	the	Cross?	A.	The	Stations	or	Way	of the	Cross	is	a	devotion	instituted	by	the	Church	to	aid	us	in	meditating	on Christ's	passion	and	death.	Fourteen	crosses	or	stations,	each	with	a	picture	of some	scene	in	the	passion,	are	arranged	at	distances	apart.	By	passing	from	one station	to	another	and	praying	before	each	while	we	meditate	upon	the	scene	it represents,	we	make	the	Way	of	the	Cross	in	memory	of	Christ's	painful	journey during	His	passion,	and	we	gain	the	indulgence	granted	for	this	pious	exercise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1058.	Are	prayers	and	ceremonies	of	the	Church	also	Sacramentals?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prayers	and	ceremonies	of	the	Church	are	also	Sacramentals	because	they	excite</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>good	thoughts	and	increase	devotion.	Whatever	the	Church	dedicates	to	a	pious use	or	devotes	to	the	worship	of	God	may	be	called	a	Sacramental. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1059.	On	what	ground	does	the	Church	make	use	of	ceremonies?	A.	The Church	makes	use	of	ceremonies	(1)	After	the	example	of	the	Old	Law,	in	which God	described	and	commanded	ceremonies;	(2)	after	the	example	of	Our	Lord, who	rubbed	clay	on	the	eyes	of	the	blind	to	whom	He	wished	to	restore	sight, though	He	might	have	performed	the	miracle	without	any	external	act;	(3)	on	the authority	of	the	Church	itself,	to	whom	Christ	gave	power	to	do	whatever	was necessary	for	the	instruction	of	all	men;	(4)	to	add	solemnity	to	religious	acts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1060.	How	may	persons	sin	in	using	Sacramentals?	A.	Persons	may	sin	in using	Sacramentals	by	using	them	in	a	way	or	for	a	purpose	prohibited	by	the Church;	also	by	believing	that	the	use	of	Sacramentals	will	save	us	in	spite	of our	sinful	lives.	We	must	remember	that	Sacramentals	can	aid	us	only	through the	blessing	the	Church	gives	them	and	through	the	good	dispositions	they	excite in	us.	They	have,	therefore,	no	power	in	themselves,	and	to	put	too	much confidence	in	their	use	leads	to	superstition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1061.	{293}	What	is	the	difference	between	the	Sacraments	and	the sacramentals?	A.	The	difference	between	the	Sacraments	and	the	sacramentals is:	1st.	The	Sacraments	were	instituted	by	Jesus	Christ	and	the	sacramentals were	instituted	by	the	Church;	2d.	The	Sacraments	give	grace	of	themselves when	we	place	no	obstacle	in	the	way;	the	sacramentals	excite	in	us	pious dispositions,	by	means	of	which	we	may	obtain	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1062.	May	the	Church	increase	or	diminish	the	number	of	Sacraments	and Sacramentals?	A.	The	Church	can	never	increase	nor	diminish	the	number	of Sacraments,	for	as	Christ	Himself	instituted	them,	He	alone	has	power	to	change their	number;	but	the	Church	may	increase	or	diminish	the	number	of	the Sacramentals	as	the	devotion	of	its	people	or	the	circumstances	of	the	time	and place	require,	for	since	the	Church	instituted	them	they	must	depend	entirely upon	its	laws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1063.	{294}	Which	is	the	chief	sacramental	used	in	the	Church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	chief	sacramental	used	in	the	Church	is	the	sign	of	the	cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1064.	{295}	How	do	we	make	the	sign	of	the	cross?	A.	We	make	the	sign	of the	cross	by	putting	the	right	hand	to	the	forehead,	then	on	the	breast,	and	then	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>the	left	and	right	shoulders,	saying,	"In	the	name	of	the	Father,	and	of	the	Son, and	of	the	Holy	Ghost,	Amen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1065.	What	is	a	common	fault	with	many	in	blessing	themselves?	A.	A common	fault	with	many	in	blessing	themselves	is	to	make	a	hurried	motion with	the	hand	which	is	in	no	way	a	sign	of	the	cross.	They	perform	this	act	of devotion	without	thought	or	intention,	forgetting	that	the	Church	grants	an indulgence	to	all	who	bless	themselves	properly	while	they	have	sorrow	for	their sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1066.	{296}	Why	do	we	make	the	sign	of	the	cross?	A.	We	make	the	sign	of the	cross	to	show	that	we	are	Christians	and	to	profess	our	belief	in	the	chief mysteries	of	our	religion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1067.	{297}	How	is	the	sign	of	the	cross	a	profession	of	faith	in	the	chief mysteries	of	our	religion?	A.	The	sign	of	the	cross	is	a	profession	of	faith	in	the chief	mysteries	of	our	religion	because	it	expresses	the	mysteries	of	the	Unity and	Trinity	of	God	and	of	the	Incarnation	and	death	of	our	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1068.	{298}	How	does	the	sign	of	the	cross	express	the	mystery	of	the	Unity and	Trinity	of	God?	A.	The	words,	"In	the	name,"	express	the	Unity	of	God;	the words	that	follow,	"of	the	Father,	and	of	the	Son,	and	of	the	Holy	Ghost," </p>
<p class="calibre1">express	the	mystery	of	the	Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1069.	{299}	How	does	the	sign	of	the	cross	express	the	mystery	of	the Incarnation	and	death	of	our	Lord?	A.	The	sign	of	the	cross	expresses	the mystery	of	the	Incarnation	by	reminding	us	that	the	Son	of	God,	having	become man,	suffered	death	on	the	cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1070.	{300}	What	other	sacramental	is	in	very	frequent	use? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Another	sacramental	in	very	frequent	use	is	holy	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1071.	{301}	What	is	holy	water? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Holy	water	is	water	blessed	by	the	priest	with	solemn	prayer	to	beg God's	blessing	on	those	who	use	it,	and	protection	from	the	powers	of darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1072.	How	does	the	water	blessed	on	Holy	Saturday,	or	Easter	Water,	as	it	is called,	differ	from	the	holy	water	blessed	at	other	times?	A.	The	water	blessed on	Holy	Saturday,	or	Easter	Water,	as	it	is	called,	differs	from	the	holy	water</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>blessed	at	other	times	in	this,	that	the	Easter	water	is	blessed	with	greater solemnity,	the	paschal	candle,	which	represents	Our	Lord	risen	from	the	dead, having	been	dipped	into	it	with	a	special	prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1073.	Is	water	ever	blessed	in	honor	of	certain	saints?	A.	Water	is	sometimes blessed	in	honor	of	certain	saints	and	for	special	purposes.	The	form	of	prayer	to be	used	in	such	blessings	is	found	in	the	Roman	Ritual—the	book	containing prayers	and	ceremonies	for	the	administration	of	the	Sacraments	and	of	blessings authorized	by	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1074.	{302}	Are	there	other	sacramentals	besides	the	sign	of	the	cross	and holy	water?	A.	Beside	the	sign	of	the	cross	and	holy	water	there	are	many	other sacramentals,	such	as	blessed	candles,	ashes,	palms,	crucifixes,	images	of	the Blessed	Virgin	and	of	the	saints,	rosaries,	and	scapulars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1075.	When	are	candles	blessed	in	the	Church	and	why	are	they	used?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Candles	are	blessed	in	the	Church	on	the	feast	of	the	Purification	of	the	Blessed Virgin—February	2nd.	They	are	used	chiefly	to	illuminate	and	ornament	our altars,	as	a	mark	of	reverence	for	the	presence	of	Our	Lord	and	of	joy	at	His coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1076.	What	praiseworthy	custom	is	now	in	use	in	many	places?	A.	A praiseworthy	custom	now	in	use	in	many	places	is	the	offering	by	the	faithful	on the	feast	of	the	Purification	of	candles	for	the	use	of	the	altar	during	the	year.	It is	pleasing	to	think	we	have	candles	burning	in	our	name	on	the	altar	of	God, and	if	the	Jewish	people	yearly	made	offerings	to	their	temple,	faithful	Christians should	not	neglect	their	altars	and	churches	where	God	Himself	dwells. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1077.	When	are	ashes	blessed	in	the	Church	and	why	are	they	used?	A.	Ashes are	blessed	in	the	Church	on	Ash	Wednesday.	They	are	used	to	keep	us	in	mind of	our	humble	origin,	and	of	how	the	body	of	Adam,	our	forefather,	was	formed out	of	the	slime	or	clay	of	the	earth;	also	to	remind	us	of	death,	when	our	bodies will	return	to	dust,	and	of	the	necessity	of	doing	penance	for	our	sins.	These ashes	are	obtained	by	burning	the	blessed	palms	of	the	previous	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1078.	When	are	palms	blessed	and	of	what	do	they	remind	us?	A.	Palms	are blessed	on	Palm	Sunday.	They	remind	us	of	Our	Lord's	triumphal	entry	into Jerusalem,	when	the	people,	wishing	to	honor	Him	and	make	Him	king,	strewed palm	branches	and	even	their	own	garments	in	His	path,	singing:	Hosanna	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>Son	of	David. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1079.	What	is	the	difference	between	a	cross	and	a	crucifix? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	A	cross	has	no	figure	on	it	and	a	crucifix	has	a	figure	of	Our	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	word	crucifix	means	fixed	or	nailed	to	the	cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1080.	What	is	the	Rosary?	A.	The	Rosary	is	a	form	of	prayer	in	which	we	say a	certain	number	of	Our	Fathers	and	Hail	Marys,	meditating	or	thinking	for	a short	time	before	each	decade;	that	is,	before	each	Our	Father	and	ten	Hail Marys,	on	some	particular	event	in	the	life	of	Our	Lord.	These	events	are	called mysteries	of	the	Rosary.	The	string	of	beads	on	which	these	prayers	are	said	is also	called	a	Rosary.	The	ordinary	beads	are	of	five	decades,	or	one-third	of	the whole	Rosary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1081.	Who	taught	the	use	of	the	Rosary	in	its	present	form?	A.	St.	Dominic taught	the	use	of	the	Rosary	in	its	present	form.	By	it	he	instructed	his	hearers	in the	chief	truths	of	our	holy	religion	and	converted	many	to	the	true	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1082.	How	do	we	say	the	Rosary,	or	beads?	A.	To	say	the	Rosary	or	beads	we bless	ourselves	with	the	cross,	then	say	the	Apostles'	Creed	and	the	Our	Father on	the	first	large	bead,	then	the	Hail	Mary	on	each	of	the	three	small	beads,	and then	Glory	be	to	the	Father,	&amp;c.	Then	we	mention	or	think	of	the	first	mystery we	wish	to	honor,	and	say	an	Our	Father	on	the	large	bead	and	a	Hail	Mary	on each	small	bead	of	the	ten	that	follow.	At	the	end	of	every	decade,	or	ten	Hail Marys,	we	say	"Glory	be	to	the	Father;"	&amp;c.	Then	we	mention	the	next	mystery and	do	as	before,	and	so	on	to	the	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1083.	How	many	mysteries	of	the	Rosary	are	there?	A.	There	are	fifteen mysteries	of	the	Rosary	arranged	in	the	order	in	which	these	events	occurred	in the	life	of	Our	Lord,	and	divided	into	five	joyful,	five	sorrowful,	and	five glorious	mysteries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1084.	Say	the	five	joyful	mysteries	of	the	Rosary.	A.	The	five	joyful mysteries	of	the	Rosary	are:	(1)	The	Annunciation—the	Angel	Gabriel	telling the	Blessed	Virgin	that	she	is	to	be	the	Mother	of	God;	(2)	the	Visitation—the Blessed	Virgin	goes	to	visit	her	cousin,	St.	Elizabeth,	the	mother	of	St.	John	the Baptist;	(3)	the	Nativity,	or	birth,	of	Our	Lord;	(4)	the	Presentation	of	the	Child Jesus	in	the	temple—His	parents	offered	Him	to	God;	(5)	the	finding	of	the Child	Jesus	in	the	temple—His	parents	had	lost	Him	in	Jerusalem	for	three	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>Q.	1085.	Say	the	five	sorrowful	mysteries	of	the	Rosary.	A.	The	five	sorrowful mysteries	of	the	Rosary	are:	(1)	The	Agony	in	the	Garden—Our	Lord	was	in dreadful	anguish	and	bathed	in	a	bloody	sweat;	(2)	the	Scourging	at	the	Pillar—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ	was	stripped	of	His	garments	and	lashed	in	a	cruel	manner;	(3)	the Crowning	with	Thorns—He	was	mocked	as	a	king	by	heartless	men;	(4)	the Carriage	of	the	Cross—from	the	place	He	was	condemned	to	Calvary,	the	place of	Crucifixion;	(5)	the	Crucifixion—He	was	nailed	to	the	cross	amid	the	jeers and	blasphemies	of	His	enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1086.	Say	the	five	glorious	mysteries	of	the	Rosary.	A.	The	five	glorious mysteries	of	the	Rosary	are:	(1)	The	Resurrection	of	Our	Lord;	(2)	the	Ascension of	Our	Lord;	(3)	The	Coming	of	the	Holy	Ghost	upon	the	Apostles;	(4)	the Assumption	of	the	Blessed	Virgin—after	death	she	was	taken	body	and	soul	into heaven;	(5)	the	Coronation	of	the	Blessed	Virgin—on	entering	heaven	she	was made	queen	of	all	the	Angels	and	Saints	and	placed	in	dignity	next	to	her	Divine Son,	Our	Blessed	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1087.	On	what	days,	according	to	the	pious	custom	of	the	faithful,	are	the different	mysteries	of	the	Rosary	usually	said?	A.	According	to	the	pious	custom of	the	faithful,	the	different	mysteries	of	the	Rosary	are	usually	said	on	the following	days,	namely:	the	joyful	on	Mondays	and	Thursdays,	the	sorrowful	on Tuesdays	and	Fridays,	and	the	glorious	on	Sundays,	Wednesdays	and	Saturdays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1088.	What	do	the	letters	I.N.R.I.	over	the	crucifix	mean?	A.	The	letters I.N.R.I.	over	the	crucifix	are	the	first	letters	of	four	Latin	words	that	mean	Jesus of	Nazareth,	King	of	the	Jews.	Our	Lord	did	say	He	was	king	of	the	Jews,	but	He also	said	that	He	was	not	their	temporal	or	earthly	king,	but	their	spiritual	and heavenly	king. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1089.	To	what	may	we	attribute	the	desire	of	the	Jews	to	put	Christ	to	death? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	may	attribute	the	desire	of	the	Jews	to	put	Christ	to	death	to	the	jealously, hatred	and	ill-will	of	their	priests	and	the	Pharisees,	whose	faults	He	rebuked	and whose	hypocrisy	He	exposed.	By	their	slanders	and	lies	they	induced	the	people to	follow	them	in	demanding	Our	Lord's	crucifixion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1090.	With	whom	did	the	Blessed	Virgin	live	after	the	death	of	Our	Lord?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	death	of	Our	Lord	the	Blessed	Virgin	lived	for	about	eleven	years	with the	Apostle	St.	John	the	Evangelist,	called	also	the	Beloved	Disciple.	He	wrote one	of	the	four	Gospels,	three	Epistles,	and	the	Apocalypse,	or	Book	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>Revelations—the	last	book	of	the	Bible.	He	lived	to	the	age	of	a	hundred	years or	more	and	died	last	of	all	the	apostles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1091.	What	do	we	mean	by	the	Assumption	of	the	Blessed	Virgin,	and	why do	we	believe	in	it?	A.	By	the	Assumption	of	the	Blessed	Virgin	we	mean	that her	body	was	taken	up	into	heaven	after	her	death.	We	believe	in	it:	(1)	Because the	Church	cannot	teach	error,	and	yet	from	an	early	age	the	Church	has celebrated	the	Feast	of	the	Assumption;	(2)	because	no	one	ever	claimed	to	have a	relic	of	our	Blessed	Mother's	body,	and	surely	the	apostles,	who	knew	and loved	her,	would	have	secured	some	relic	had	her	body	remained	upon	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1092.	What	do	the	letters	I.H.S.	on	an	altar	or	sacred	things	mean?	A.	The letters	I.H.S.	on	an	altar	or	sacred	things	mean	the	name	Jesus;	for	it	is	in	that way	the	Holy	Name	is	written	in	the	Greek	language	when	some	of	the	letters are	left	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1093.	What	is	the	scapular,	and	why	is	it	worn?	A.	The	scapular	is	a	long, broad	piece	of	woolen	cloth	forming	a	part	of	the	religious	dress	of	monks, priests	and	sisters	of	some	religious	orders.	It	is	worn	over	the	shoulders	and extends	from	the	shoulders	to	the	feet.	The	small	scapular	made	in	imitation	of it,	and	consisting	of	two	small	pieces	of	cloth	fastened	together	by	strings,	is worn	by	the	faithful	as	a	promise	or	proof	of	their	willingness	to	practice	some particular	devotion,	indicated	by	the	kind	of	scapular	they	wear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1094.	How	many	kinds	of	scapulars	are	there	in	use	among	the	faithful?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among	the	faithful	there	are	many	kinds	of	scapulars	in	use,	such	as	the	brown scapular	or	scapular	of	Mount	Carmel	worn	in	honor	of	Our	Lord's	passion;	the white,	in	honor	of	the	Holy	Trinity;	the	blue,	in	honor	of	the	Immaculate Conception;	and	the	black,	in	honor	of	the	seven	dolors	of	the	Blessed	Virgin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	these	are	joined	together	and	worn	as	one	they	are	called	the	five scapulars.	The	brown	scapular	is	best	known	and	entitles	its	wearer	to	the greatest	privileges	and	indulgences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1095.	What	are	the	seven	dolors	of	the	Blessed	Virgin?	A.	The	seven	dolors of	the	Blessed	Virgin	are	the	chief	sorrowful	events	in	the	life	of	Our	Blessed Lady.	They	are	(1)	The	Circumcision	of	Our	Lord—when	she	saw	His	blood shed	for	the	first	time;	(2)	her	flight	into	Egypt—to	save	the	life	of	the	Infant Jesus,	when	Herod	sought	to	kill	Him;	(3)	the	three	days	she	lost	her	Son	in Jerusalem;	(4)	when	she	saw	Him	carrying	the	cross;	(5)	when	she	saw	Him	die; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>(6)	when	His	dead	body	was	taken	down	from	the	cross;	(7)	when	it	was	laid	in the	sepulchre	or	tomb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1096.	What	are	the	seven	dolor	beads,	and	how	do	we	say	them?	A.	Seven dolor	beads	are	beads	constructed	with	seven	medals,	each	bearing	a representation	of	one	of	the	seven	dolors,	and	seven	beads	between	each	medal and	the	next.	At	each	medal	we	meditate	on	the	proper	dolor	and	the	say	a	Hail Mary	on	each	of	the	bead	following	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>Q.	1097.	What	is	an	Agnus	Dei?	A.	An	Agnus	Dei	is	a	small	piece	of	beeswax stamped	with	the	image	of	a	lamb	and	cross.	It	is	solemnly	blessed	by	the	Pope with	special	prayers	for	those	who	carry	it	about	their	person	in	honor	of	Our Blessed	Redeemer,	whom	we	call	the	Lamb	of	God,	Who	taketh	away	the	sins	of the	world.	The	wax	is	usually	covered	with	silk	or	some	fine	material. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	1098.	{303}	Is	there	any	other	means	of	obtaining	God's	grace	than the	Sacraments? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	There	is	another	means	of	obtaining	God's	grace,	and	it	is	prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1099.	{304}	What	is	prayer? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Prayer	is	the	lifting	up	of	our	minds	and	hearts	to	God,	to	adore Him,	to	thank	Him	for	His	benefits,	to	ask	His	forgiveness,	and	to	beg of	Him	all	the	graces	we	need	whether	for	soul	or	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1100.	How	many	kinds	of	prayer	are	there?	A.	There	are	two	kinds	of	prayer: (1)	Mental	prayer,	called	meditation,	in	which	we	spend	the	time	thinking	of God	or	of	one	or	more	of	the	truths	He	has	revealed,	that	by	these	thoughts	we may	be	persuaded	to	lead	holier	lives;	(2)	vocal	prayer,	in	which	we	express these	pious	thoughts	in	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1101.	Why	is	mental	prayer	most	useful	to	us?	A.	Mental	prayer	is	most useful	to	us	because	it	compels	us,	while	we	are	engaged	in	it,	to	keep	our attention	fixed	on	God	and	His	holy	laws	and	to	keep	our	hearts	and	minds	lifted up	to	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1102.	How	can	we	make	a	meditation?	A.	We	can	make	a	meditation	(1)	By remembering	that	we	are	in	the	presence	of	God;	(2)	by	asking	the	Holy	Ghost	to give	us	grace	to	benefit	by	the	meditation;	(3)	by	reflecting	seriously	on	some sacred	truth	regarding	our	salvation;	(4)	by	drawing	some	good	resolution	from the	thoughts	we	have	had;	and	(5)	by	thanking	God	for	the	knowledge	and	grace bestowed	on	us	through	the	meditation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1103.	Where	may	we	find	subjects	or	points	for	meditation? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>A.	We	may	find	the	subjects	or	points	for	meditation	in	the	words	of	the Our	Father,	Hail	Mary	or	Apostles'	Creed;	also	in	the	questions	and answers	of	our	Catechism,	in	the	Holy	Bible,	and	in	books	of	meditation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1104.	{305}	Is	prayer	necessary	to	salvation?	A.	Prayer	is	necessary	to salvation,	and	without	it	no	one	having	the	use	of	reason	can	be	saved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1105.	{306}	At	what	particular	times	should	we	pray?	A.	We	should	pray particularly	on	Sundays	and	holy	days,	every	morning	and	night,	in	all	dangers, temptations,	and	afflictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1106.	{307}	How	should	we	pray?	A.	We	should	pray:	1st.	With	attention; 2d.	With	a	sense	of	our	own	helplessness	and	dependence	upon	God;	3d.	With	a great	desire	for	the	graces	we	beg	of	God;	4th.	With	trust	in	God's	goodness;	5th. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	perseverance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1107.	What	should	our	attention	at	prayer	be?	A.	Our	attention	at	prayer should	be	threefold,	namely,	attention	to	the	words,	that	we	may	say	them correctly	and	distinctly;	attention	to	their	meaning,	if	we	understand	it,	and attention	to	God,	to	whom	the	words	are	addressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1108.	What	should	be	the	position	of	the	body	when	we	pray?	A.	At	prayer the	most	becoming	position	of	the	body	is	kneeling	upright,	but	whether	we	pray kneeling,	standing	or	sitting,	the	position	of	the	body	should	always	be	one indicating	reverence,	respect	and	devotion.	We	may	pray	even	lying	down	or walking,	for	Our	Lord	Himself	says	we	should	pray	at	all	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1109.	What	should	we	do	that	we	may	pray	well?	A.	That	we	may	pray	well we	should	make	a	preparation	before	prayer:	(1)	By	calling	to	mind	the	dignity of	God,	to	whom	we	are	about	to	speak,	and	our	own	unworthiness	to	appear	in His	presence;	(2)	by	fixing	upon	the	precise	grace	or	blessing	for	which	we intend	to	ask;	(3)	by	remembering	God's	power	and	willingness	to	give	if	we truly	need	and	earnestly,	humbly	and	confidently	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1110.	Why	does	God	not	always	grant	our	prayers?	A.	God	does	not	always grant	our	prayers	for	these	and	other	reasons:	(1)	Because	we	may	not	pray	in the	proper	manner;	(2)	that	we	may	learn	our	dependence	on	Him,	prove	our confidence	in	Him,	and	merit	rewards	by	our	patience	and	perseverance	in prayer.	Prudent	persons	do	not	grant	every	request;	why,	then,	should	God	do	so? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>Q.	1111.	What	assurance	have	we	that	God	always	hears	and	rewards	our prayers,	though	He	may	not	grant	what	we	ask?	A.	We	have	the	assurance	of	Our Lord	Himself	that	God	always	hears	and	rewards	our	prayers,	though	He	may not	grant	what	we	ask;	for	Christ	said:	"Ask	and	it	shall	be	given	you,"	and	"if you	ask	the	Father	anything	in	My	name,	He	will	give	it	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1112.	{308}	Which	are	the	prayers	most	recommended	to	us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	prayers	most	recommended	to	us	are	the	Lord's	Prayer,	the	Hail Mary,	the	Apostles'	Creed,	the	Confiteor,	and	the	Acts	of	Faith,	Hope, Love,	and	Contrition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1113.	{309}	Are	prayers	said	with	distractions	of	any	avail? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Prayers	said	with	wilful	distraction	are	of	no	avail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1114.	Why	are	prayers	said	with	wilful	distraction	of	no	avail?	A.	Prayers said	with	wilful	distraction	are	of	no	avail	because	they	are	mere	words,	such	as a	machine	might	utter,	and	since	there	is	no	lifting	up	of	the	mind	or	heart	with them	they	cannot	be	prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1115.	Do,	then,	the	distractions	which	we	often	have	at	prayer	deprive	our prayers	of	all	merit?	A.	The	distractions	which	we	often	have	at	prayer	do	not deprive	our	prayers	of	all	merit,	because	they	are	not	wilful	when	we	try	to	keep them	away,	for	God	rewards	our	good	intentions	and	the	efforts	we	make	to	pray well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1116.	What,	then,	is	a	distraction?	A.	A	distraction	is	any	thought	that,	during prayer,	enters	our	mind	to	turn	our	thoughts	and	hearts	from	God	and	from	the sacred	duty	we	are	performing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1117.	What	are	the	fruits	of	prayer?	A.	The	fruits	of	prayer	are:	It	strengthens our	faith,	nourishes	our	hope,	increases	our	love	for	God,	keeps	us	humble, merits	grace	and	atones	for	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1118.	Why	should	we	pray	when	God	knows	our	needs?	A.	We	pray	not	to remind	God	or	tell	Him	of	what	we	need,	but	to	acknowledge	that	He	is	the Supreme	Giver,	to	adore	and	worship	Him	by	showing	our	entire	dependence upon	Him	for	every	gift	to	soul	or	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1119.	What	little	prayers	may	we	say	even	at	work? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Even	at	work	we	may	say	little	aspirations	such	as	"My	God,	pardon	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>sins;	Blessed	be	the	Holy	Name	of	Jesus;	Holy	Spirit,	enlighten	me;	Holy Mary,	pray	for	me,"	&amp;c. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1120.	Did	Our	Lord	Himself	pray,	and	why?	A.	Our	Lord	Himself	very frequently	prayed,	often	spending	the	whole	night	in	prayer.	He	prayed	before every	important	action,	not	that	He	needed	to	pray,	but	to	set	us	an	example	of how	and	when	we	should	pray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1121.	Why	does	the	Church	conclude	most	of	its	prayers	with	the	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">"through	Jesus	Christ	Our	Lord"?	A.	The	Church	concludes	most	of	its	prayers with	the	words	"through	Jesus	Christ	Our	Lord"	because	it	is	only	through	His merits	that	we	can	obtain	grace,	and	because	"there	is	no	other	name	given	to men	whereby	we	must	be	saved." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1122.	Was	any	special	promise	made	in	favor	of	the	united	prayers	of	two	or more	persons?	A.	A	special	promise	was	made	in	favor	of	the	united	prayers	of two	or	more	persons	when	Our	Lord	said:	"Where	there	are	two	or	three gathered	together	in	My	name,	there	am	I	in	the	midst	of	them."	Therefore,	the united	prayers	of	a	congregation,	sodality	or	family,	and,	above	all,	the	public prayers	of	the	whole	Church,	have	great	influence	with	God.	We	should	join	in public	prayers	out	of	true	devotion,	and	not	from	habit,	or,	worse,	to	display	our piety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1123.	What	is	the	most	suitable	place	for	prayer?	A.	The	most	suitable	place for	prayer	is	in	the	Church—the	house	of	prayer—made	holy	by	special blessings	and,	above	all,	by	the	Real	Presence	of	Jesus	dwelling	in	the Tabernacle.	Still,	Our	Lord	exhorts	us	to	pray	also	in	secret,	for	His	Father,	who seeth	in	secret,	will	repay	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1124.	For	what	should	we	pray?	A.	We	should	pray	(1)	For	ourselves,	for	the blessings	of	soul	and	body	that	we	may	be	devoted	servants	of	God;	(2)	for	the Church,	for	all	spiritual	and	temporal	wants,	that	the	true	faith	may	be everywhere	known	and	professed;	(3)	for	our	relatives,	friends	and	benefactors, particularly	for	those	we	may	in	any	way	have	injured;	(4)	for	all	men,	for	the protection	of	the	good	and	conversion	of	the	wicked,	that	virtue	may	flourish	and vice	disappear;	(5)	for	our	spiritual	rulers,	the	Pope,	our	bishops,	priests	and religious	communities,	that	they	may	faithfully	perform	their	sacred	duties;	(6) for	our	country	and	temporal	rulers,	that	they	may	use	their	power	for	the	good of	their	subjects	and	for	the	honor	and	glory	of	God. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	1125.	{310}	Is	it	enough	to	belong	to	God's	Church	in	order	to	be saved? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	It	is	not	enough	to	belong	to	the	Church	in	order	to	be	saved,	but	we must	also	keep	the	Commandments	of	God	and	of	the	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1126.	Are	not	the	commandments	of	the	Church	also	commandments	of	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	commandments	of	the	Church	are	also	commandments	of	God,	for	they are	made	by	His	authority	and	under	the	guidance	of	the	Holy	Ghost; nevertheless,	the	Church	can	change	or	abolish	its	own	commandments,	while	it cannot	change	or	abolish	the	commandments	given	directly	by	God	Himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1127.	{311}	Which	are	the	Commandments	that	contain	the	whole	law	of God?	A.	The	Commandments	which	contain	the	whole	law	of	God	are	these two:	1st.	Thou	shalt	love	the	Lord	thy	God	with	thy	whole	heart,	with	thy	whole soul,	with	thy	whole	strength,	and	with	thy	whole	mind;	2.	Thou	shalt	love	thy neighbor	as	thyself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1128.	{312}	Why	do	these	two	Commandments	of	the	love	of	God	and	of	our neighbor	contain	the	whole	law	of	God?	A.	These	two	Commandments	of	the love	of	God	and	of	our	neighbor	contain	the	whole	law	of	God	because	all	the other	Commandments	are	given	either	to	help	us	to	keep	these	two,	or	to	direct us	how	to	shun	what	is	opposed	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1129.	Explain	further	how	the	two	commandments	of	the	love	of	God	and	of our	neighbor	contain	the	teaching	of	the	whole	ten	commandments.	A.	The	two commandments	of	the	love	of	God	and	of	our	neighbor	contain	the	teaching	of the	whole	ten	commandments	because	the	first	three	of	the	ten	commandments refer	to	God	and	oblige	us	to	worship	Him	alone,	respect	His	name	and	serve Him	as	He	wills,	and	these	things	we	will	do	if	we	love	Him;	secondly,	the	last seven	of	the	ten	commandments	refer	to	our	neighbor	and	forbid	us	to	injure	him in	body,	soul,	goods	or	reputation,	and	if	we	love	him	we	will	do	him	no	injury in	any	of	these,	but,	on	the	contrary,	aid	him	as	far	as	we	can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1130.	{313}	Which	are	the	Commandments	of	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	Commandments	of	God	are	these	ten:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>	1.	I	am	the	Lord	thy	God,	who	brought	thee	out	of	the	land	of	Egypt, out	of	the	house	of	bondage.	Thou	shalt	not	have	strange	gods	before me.	Thou	shalt	not	make	to	thyself	a	graven	thing,	nor	the	likeness of	any	thing	that	is	in	heaven	above,	or	in	the	earth	beneath,	nor of	those	things	that	are	in	the	waters	under	the	earth.	Thou	shalt not	adore	them,	nor	serve	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.	Thou	shalt	not	take	the	name	of	the	Lord	thy	God	in	vain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.	Remember	thou	keep	holy	the	Sabbath	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4.	Honor	thy	father	and	thy	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5.	Thou	shalt	not	kill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6.	Thou	shalt	not	commit	adultery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7.	Thou	shalt	not	steal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8.	Thou	shalt	not	bear	false	witness	against	thy	neighbor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">9.	Thou	shalt	not	covet	thy	neighbor's	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">10.	Thou	shalt	not	covet	thy	neighbor's	goods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1131.	What	does	the	first	commandment	mean	by	a	"graven	thing"	or	"the likeness	of	anything"	in	heaven,	in	the	earth	or	in	the	waters?	A.	The	first commandment	means	by	a	"graven	thing"	or	"the	likeness	of	anything"	in heaven,	in	the	earth	or	in	the	waters,	the	statue,	picture	or	image	of	any	creature in	heaven	or	of	any	animal	on	land	or	in	water	intended	for	an	idol	and	to	be worshipped	as	a	god. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1132.	{314}	Who	gave	the	Ten	Commandments? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	God	Himself	gave	the	Ten	Commandments	to	Moses	on	Mount	Sinai,	and Christ	our	Lord	confirmed	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1133.	How	and	when	were	the	Commandments	given	to	Moses?	A.	The Commandments,	written	on	two	tables	of	stone,	were	given	to	Moses	in	the midst	of	fire	and	smoke,	thunder	and	lightning,	from	which	God	spoke	to	him	on the	mountain,	about	fifty	days	after	the	Israelites	were	delivered	from	the bondage	of	Egypt	and	while	they	were	on	their	journey	through	the	desert	to	the Promised	Land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1134.	What	do	we	mean	when	we	say	Christ	confirmed	the	Commandments? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	When	we	say	Christ	confirmed	the	Commandments	we	mean	that	He	strongly approved	them,	and	gave	us	by	His	teaching	a	fuller	and	clearer	knowledge	of their	meaning	and	importance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>Q.	1135.	Was	anyone	obliged	to	keep	the	Commandments	before	they	were given	to	Moses?	A.	All	persons,	from	the	beginning	of	the	world,	were	obliged to	keep	the	Commandments,	for	it	was	always	sinful	to	blaspheme	God,	murder, steal	or	violate	any	of	the	Commandments,	though	they	were	not	written	till	the time	of	Moses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1136.	How	many	kinds	of	laws	had	the	Jews	before	the	coming	of	Our	Lord? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Before	the	coming	of	Our	Lord	the	Jews	had	three	kinds	of	laws:	(1)	Civil laws,	regulating	the	affairs	of	their	nation;	(2)	ceremonial	laws,	governing	their worship	in	the	temple;	(3)	moral	laws,	guiding	their	religious	belief	and	actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1137.	To	which	of	these	laws	did	the	Ten	Commandments	belong?	A.	The Ten	Commandments	belong	to	the	moral	law,	because	they	are	a	compendium	or short	account	of	what	we	must	do	in	order	to	save	our	souls;	just	as	the	Apostles' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Creed	is	a	compendium	of	what	we	must	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1138.	When	did	the	civil	and	ceremonial	laws	of	the	Jews	cease	to	exist?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	civil	laws	of	the	Jews	ceased	to	exist	when	the	Jewish	people,	shortly	before the	coming	of	Christ,	ceased	to	be	an	independent	nation.	The	ceremonial	laws ceased	to	exist	when	the	Jewish	religion	ceased	to	be	the	true	religion;	that	is, when	Christ	established	the	Christian	religion,	of	which	the	Jewish	religion	was only	a	figure	or	promise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1139.	Why	were	not	also	the	moral	laws	of	the	Jews	abolished	when	the Christian	religion	was	established?	A.	The	moral	laws	of	the	Jews	could	not	be abolished	by	the	establishment	of	the	Christian	religion	because	they	regard	truth and	virtue	and	have	been	revealed	by	God,	and	whatever	God	has	revealed	as true	must	be	always	true,	and	whatever	He	has	condemned	as	bad	in	itself	must be	always	bad. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	1141.	What	does	the	commandment	mean	by	"strange	gods"? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>A.	By	strange	gods	the	commandment	means	idols	or	false	gods,	which	the Israelites	frequently	worshipped	when,	through	their	sins,	they	had abandoned	the	true	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1142.	How	may	we,	in	a	sense,	worship	strange	gods?	A.	We,	in	a	sense,	may worship	strange	gods	by	giving	up	the	salvation	of	our	souls	for	wealth,	honors, society,	worldly	pleasures,	&amp;c.,	so	that	we	would	offend	God,	renounce	our	faith or	give	up	the	practice	of	our	religion	for	their	sake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1143.	{316}	How	does	the	first	Commandment	help	us	to	keep	the	great Commandment	of	the	love	of	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	first	Commandment	helps	us	to	keep	the	great	Commandment	of	the love	of	God	because	it	commands	us	to	adore	God	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1144.	{317}	How	do	we	adore	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	adore	God	by	faith,	hope,	and	charity,	by	prayer	and	sacrifice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1145.	By	what	prayers	do	we	adore	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	adore	God	by	all	our	prayers,	but	in	particular	by	the	public prayers	of	the	Church,	and,	above	all,	by	the	Holy	Sacrifice	of	the Mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1146.	{318}	How	may	the	first	Commandment	be	broken?	A.	The	first Commandment	make	be	broken	by	giving	to	a	creature	the	honor	which	belongs to	God	alone;	by	false	worship;	and	by	attributing	to	a	creature	a	perfection which	belongs	to	God	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1147.	What	is	the	honor	which	belongs	to	God	alone?	A.	The	honor	which belongs	to	God	alone	is	a	divine	honor,	in	which	we	offer	Him	sacrifice,	incense or	prayer,	solely	for	His	own	sake	and	for	His	own	glory.	To	give	such	honor	to any	creature,	however	holy,	would	be	idolatry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1148.	How	do	we	offer	God	false	worship?	A.	We	offer	God	false	worship	by rejecting	the	religion	He	has	instituted	and	following	one	pleasing	to	ourselves, with	a	form	of	worship	He	has	never	authorized,	approved	or	sanctioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1149.	Why	must	we	serve	God	in	the	form	of	religion	He	has	instituted	and	in no	other?	A.	We	must	serve	God	in	the	form	of	religion	He	has	instituted	and	in no	other,	because	heaven	is	not	a	right,	but	a	promised	reward,	a	free	gift	of	God, which	we	must	merit	in	the	manner	He	directs	and	pleases. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>Q.	1150.	When	do	we	attribute	to	a	creature	a	perfection	which	belongs	to	God alone?	A.	We	attribute	to	a	creature	a	perfection	which	belongs	to	God	alone when	we	believe	it	possesses	knowledge	or	power	independently	of	God,	so	that it	may,	without	His	aid,	make	known	the	future	or	perform	miracles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1151.	{319}	Do	those	who	make	use	of	spells	and	charms,	or	who	believe	in dreams,	in	mediums,	spiritists,	fortune-tellers,	and	the	like,	sin	against	the	first Commandment?	A.	Those	who	make	use	of	spells	and	charms,	or	who	believe	in dreams,	in	mediums,	spiritists,	fortune-tellers,	and	the	like,	sin	against	the	first Commandment,	because	they	attribute	to	creatures	perfections	which	belong	to God	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1152.	What	are	spells	and	charms?	A.	Spells	and	charms	are	certain	words,	by the	saying	of	which	superstitious	persons	believe	they	can	avert	evil,	bring	good fortune	or	produce	some	supernatural	or	wonderful	effect.	They	may	be	also objects	or	articles	worn	about	the	body	for	the	same	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1153.	Are	not	Agnus	Deis,	medals,	scapulars,	&amp;c.,	which	we	wear	about	our bodies	also	charms?	A.	Agnus	Deis,	medals,	scapulars,	&amp;c.,	which	we	wear about	our	bodies,	are	not	charms,	for	we	do	not	expect	any	help	from	these things	themselves,	but,	through	the	blessing	they	have	received	from	the	Church, we	expect	help	from	God,	the	Blessed	Mother,	or	the	Saint	in	whose	honor	we wear	them.	On	the	contrary,	they	who	wear	charms	expect	help	from	the	charms themselves,	or	from	some	evil	spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1154.	What	must	we	carefully	guard	against	in	all	our	devotions	and	religious practices?	A.	In	all	our	devotions	and	religious	practices	we	must	carefully	guard against	expecting	God	to	perform	miracles	when	natural	causes	may	bring	about what	we	hope	for.	God	will	sometimes	miraculously	help	us,	but,	as	a	rule,	only when	all	natural	means	have	failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1155.	What	are	dreams	and	why	is	it	forbidden	to	believe	in	them?	A.	Dreams are	the	thoughts	we	have	in	sleep,	when	our	will	is	unable	to	guide	them.	It	is forbidden	to	believe	in	them,	because	they	are	often	ridiculous,	unreasonable,	or wicked,	and	are	not	governed	by	either	reason	or	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1156.	Are	bad	dreams	sinful	in	themselves?	A.	Bad	dreams	are	not	sinful	in themselves,	because	we	cannot	prevent	them,	but	we	may	make	them	sinful	(1) By	taking	pleasure	in	them	when	we	awake,	and	(2)	by	bad	reading	or	immodest</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>books,	thoughts,	word	or	actions	before	going	to	sleep;	for	by	any	of	these	things we	may	make	ourselves	responsible	for	the	bad	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1157.	Did	not	God	frequently	in	the	Old	Law	make	use	of	dreams	as	a	means of	making	known	His	will?	A.	God	did	frequently	in	the	Old	Law	make	use	of dreams	as	a	means	of	making	known	His	Will;	but	on	such	occasions	He	always gave	proof	that	what	He	made	known	was	not	a	mere	dream,	but	rather	a revelation	or	inspiration.	He	no	longer	makes	use	of	such	means,	for	He	now makes	known	His	will	through	the	inspiration	of	His	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1158.	What	are	mediums	and	spiritists?	A.	Mediums	and	spiritists	are	persons who	pretend	to	converse	with	the	dead	or	with	spirits	of	the	other	world.	They pretend	also	to	give	this	power	to	others,	that	they	may	know	what	is	going	on	in heaven,	purgatory	or	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1159.	What	other	practice	is	very	dangerous	to	faith	and	morals?	A.	Another practice	very	dangerous	to	faith	and	morals	is	the	use	of	mesmerism	or hypnotism,	because	it	is	liable	to	sinful	abuses,	for	it	deprives	a	person	for	a	time of	the	control	of	his	reason	and	will	and	places	his	body	and	mind	entirely	in	the power	of	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1160.	What	are	fortune	tellers?	A.	Fortune	tellers	are	imposters	who,	learning the	past,	or	guessing	at	it,	pretend	to	know	also	the	future	and	to	be	able	to	reveal it	to	anyone	who	pays	for	the	knowledge.	They	pretend	also	to	know	whatever concerns	things	lost	or	stolen,	and	the	secret	thoughts,	actions	or	intentions	of others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1161.	How	do	we,	by	believing	in	spells,	charms,	mediums,	spiritists	and fortune	tellers,	attribute	to	creatures	the	perfections	of	God?	A.	By	believing	in spells,	charms,	mediums,	spiritists	and	fortune	tellers	we	attribute	to	creatures the	perfections	of	God	because	we	expect	these	creatures	to	perform	miracles, reveal	the	hidden	judgments	of	God,	and	make	known	His	designs	for	the	future with	regard	to	His	creatures,	things	that	only	God	Himself	may	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1162.	Is	it	sinful	to	consult	mediums,	spiritists,	fortune	tellers	and	the	like when	we	do	not	believe	in	them,	but	through	mere	curiosity	to	hear	what	they may	say?	A.	It	is	sinful	to	consult	mediums,	spiritists,	fortune	tellers	and	the	like even	when	we	do	not	believe	in	them,	but	through	mere	curiosity,	to	hear	what they	may	say,	(1)	Because	it	is	wrong	to	expose	ourselves	to	the	danger	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>sinning	even	though	we	do	not	sin;	(2)	because	we	may	give	scandal	to	others who	are	not	certain	that	we	go	through	mere	curiosity;	(3)	because	by	our pretended	belief	we	encourage	these	impostors	to	continue	their	wicked practices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1163.	{320}	Are	sins	against	faith,	hope,	and	charity	also	sins against	the	first	Commandment? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Sins	against	faith,	hope	and	charity	are	also	sins	against	the	first Commandment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1164.	{321}	How	does	a	person	sin	against	faith?	A.	A	person	sins	against faith:	1st,	By	not	trying	to	know	what	God	has	taught;	2d,	by	refusing	to	believe all	that	God	has	taught;	3d,	by	neglecting	to	profess	his	belief	in	what	God	has taught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1165.	{322}	How	do	we	fail	to	try	to	know	what	God	has	taught? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	fail	to	try	to	know	what	God	has	taught	by	neglecting	to	learn	the Christian	doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1166.	What	means	have	we	of	learning	the	Christian	doctrine?	A.	We	have many	means	of	learning	the	Christian	doctrine:	In	youth	we	have	Catechism	and special	instructions	suited	to	our	age;	later	we	have	sermons,	missions,	retreats, religious	sodalities	and	societies	through	which	we	may	learn.	At	all	times,	we have	books	of	instruction,	and,	above	all,	the	priests	of	the	Church,	ever	ready	to teach	us.	God	will	not	excuse	our	ignorance	if	we	neglect	to	learn	our	religion when	He	has	given	us	the	means. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1167.	Should	we	learn	the	Christian	doctrine	merely	for	our	own	sake?	A.	We should	learn	the	Christian	doctrine	not	merely	for	our	own	sake,	but	for	the	sake also	of	others	who	may	sincerely	wish	to	learn	from	us	the	truths	of	our	holy faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1168.	How	should	such	instruction	be	given	to	those	who	ask	it	of	us?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	instruction	should	be	given	to	those	who	ask	it	of	us	in	a	kind	and	Christian spirit,	without	dispute	or	bitterness.	We	should	never	attempt	to	explain	the truths	of	our	religion	unless	we	are	certain	of	what	we	say.	When	we	are	unable to	answer	what	is	asked	we	should	send	those	who	inquire	to	the	priest	or	to others	better	instructed	than	ourselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1169.	{323}	Who	are	they	who	do	not	believe	all	that	God	has	taught?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>They	who	do	not	believe	all	that	God	has	taught	are	the	heretics	and	infidels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1170.	Name	the	different	classes	of	unbelievers	and	tell	what	they	are.	A.	The different	classes	of	unbelievers	are	(1)	Atheists,	who	deny	there	is	a	God;	(2) Deists,	who	admit	there	is	a	God,	but	deny	that	He	revealed	a	religion;	(3) Agnostics,	who	will	neither	admit	nor	deny	the	existence	of	God;	(4)	Infidels, who	have	never	been	baptized,	and	who,	through	want	of	faith,	refuse	to	be baptized;	(5)	Heretics,	who	have	been	baptized	Christians,	but	do	not	believe	all the	articles	of	faith;	(6)	Schismatics,	who	have	been	baptized	and	believe	all	the articles	of	faith,	but	do	not	submit	to	the	authority	of	the	Pope;	(7)	Apostates, who	have	rejected	the	true	religion,	in	which	they	formerly	believed,	to	join	a false	religion;	(8)	Rationalists	and	Materialists,	who	believe	only	in	material things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1171.	Will	the	denial	of	only	one	article	of	faith	make	a	person	a	heretic?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	denial	of	only	one	article	of	faith	will	make	a	person	a	heretic	and	guilty	of mortal	sin,	because	the	Holy	Scripture	says:	"Whosoever	shall	keep	the	whole law	but	offend	in	one	point	is	become	guilty	of	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1172.	What	is	an	article	of	faith?	A.	An	article	of	faith	is	a	revealed	truth	so important	and	so	certain	that	no	one	can	deny	or	doubt	it	without	rejecting	the testimony	of	God.	The	Church	very	clearly	points	out	what	truths	are	articles	of faith	that	we	may	distinguish	them	from	pious	beliefs	and	traditions,	so	that	no one	can	be	guilty	of	the	sin	of	heresy	without	knowing	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1173.	{324}	Who	are	they	who	neglect	to	profess	their	belief	in	what	God	has taught?	A.	They	who	neglect	to	profess	their	belief	in	what	God	has	taught	are all	those	who	fail	to	acknowledge	the	true	Church	in	which	they	really	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1174.	How	do	persons	who	are	members	of	the	Church	neglect	to	profess their	belief?	A.	Persons	who	are	members	of	the	Church	neglect	to	profess	their belief	by	living	contrary	to	the	teachings	of	the	Church:	that	is,	by	neglecting Mass	or	the	Sacraments,	doing	injury	to	their	neighbor,	and	disgracing	their religion	by	sinful	and	scandalous	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1175.	What	chiefly	prevents	persons	who	believe	in	the	Church	from becoming	members	of	it?	A.	A	want	of	Christian	courage	chiefly	prevents persons	who	believe	in	the	Church	from	becoming	members	of	it.	They	fear	too much	the	opinion	or	displeasure	of	others,	the	loss	of	position	or	wealth,	and,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>general,	the	trials	they	may	have	to	suffer	for	the	sake	of	the	true	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1176.	What	does	Our	Lord	say	of	those	who	neglect	the	true	religion	for	the sake	of	relatives	or	friends,	or	from	fear	of	suffering?	A.	Our	Lord	says	of	those who	neglect	the	true	religion	for	the	sake	of	relatives	or	friends,	or	from	fear	of suffering:	"He	that	loveth	father	or	mother	more	than	Me,	is	not	worthy	of	Me; and	he	that	loveth	son	or	daughter	more	than	Me,	is	not	worthy	of	Me";	also:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	whosoever	does	not	carry	his	cross	and	come	after	Me	cannot	be	My disciple." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1177.	What	excuse	do	some	give	for	neglecting	to	seek	and	embrace	the	true religion?	A.	Some	give	as	an	excuse	for	neglecting	to	seek	and	embrace	the	true religion	that	we	should	live	in	the	religion	in	which	we	were	born,	and	that	one religion	is	as	good	as	another	if	we	believe	we	are	serving	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1178.	How	do	we	show	that	such	an	excuse	is	false	and	absurd?	A.	We	show that	such	an	excuse	is	false	and	absurd	because	(1)	It	is	false	and	absurd	to	say that	we	should	remain	in	error	after	we	have	discovered	it;	(2)	because	if	one religion	is	as	good	as	another,	Our	Lord	would	not	have	abolished	the	Jewish religion,	nor	the	apostles	have	preached	against	heresy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1179.	{325}	Can	they	who	fail	to	profess	their	faith	in	the	true	Church	in which	they	believe	expect	to	be	saved	while	in	that	state?	A.	They	who	fail	to profess	their	faith	in	the	true	Church	in	which	they	believe	cannot	expect	to	be saved	while	in	that	state,	for	Christ	has	said:	"Whosoever	shall	deny	me	before men,	I	will	also	deny	him	before	my	Father	who	is	in	heaven." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1180.	{326}	Are	we	obliged	to	make	open	profession	of	our	faith?	A.	We	are obliged	to	make	open	profession	of	our	faith	as	often	as	God's	honor,	our neighbor's	spiritual	good	or	our	own	requires	it.	"Whosoever,"	says	Christ,	"shall confess	me	before	men,	I	will	also	confess	him	before	my	Father	who	is	in heaven." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1181.	When	does	God's	honor,	our	neighbor's	spiritual	good,	or	our	own	good require	us	to	make	an	open	profession	of	our	faith?	A.	God's	honor,	our neighbor's	spiritual	good,	or	our	own	good	requires	us	to	make	an	open profession	of	our	faith	as	often	as	we	cannot	conceal	our	religion	without violating	some	law	of	God	or	of	His	Church,	or	without	giving	scandal	to	others or	exposing	ourselves	to	the	danger	of	sinning.	Pious	practices	not	commanded</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>may	often	be	omitted	without	any	denial	of	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1182.	{327}	Which	are	the	sins	against	hope? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	sins	against	hope	are	presumption	and	despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1183.	{328}	What	is	presumption?	A.	Presumption	is	a	rash	expectation	of salvation	without	making	proper	use	of	the	necessary	means	to	obtain	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1184.	How	may	we	be	guilty	of	presumption?	A.	We	may	be	guilty	of presumption	(1)	By	putting	off	confession	when	in	a	state	of	mortal	sin;	(2)	by delaying	the	amendment	of	our	lives	and	repentance	for	past	sins;	(3)	by	being indifferent	about	the	number	of	times	we	yield	to	any	temptation	after	we	have once	yielded	and	broken	our	resolution	to	resist	it;	(4)	by	thinking	we	can	avoid sin	without	avoiding	its	near	occasion;	(5)	by	relying	too	much	on	ourselves	and neglecting	to	follow	the	advice	of	our	confessor	in	regard	to	the	sins	we	confess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1185.	{329}	What	is	despair? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Despair	is	the	loss	of	hope	in	God's	mercy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1186.	How	may	we	be	guilty	of	despair?	A.	We	may	be	guilty	of	despair	by believing	that	we	cannot	resist	certain	temptations,	overcome	certain	sins	or amend	our	lives	so	as	to	be	pleasing	to	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1187.	Are	all	sins	of	presumption	and	despair	equally	great?	A.	All	sins	of presumption	and	despair	are	not	equally	great.	They	may	be	very	slight	or	very great	in	proportion	to	the	degree	in	which	we	deny	the	justice	or	mercy	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1188.	{330}	How	do	we	sin	against	the	love	of	God?	A.	We	sin	against	the love	of	God	by	all	sin,	but	particularly	by	mortal	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LESSON	THIRTY-FIRST.	THE	FIRST	COMMANDMENT—</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ON	THE	HONOR	AND	INVOCATION	OF	THE	SAINTS. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1189.	{331}	Does	the	first	Commandment	forbid	the	honoring	of	the	saints? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	first	Commandment	does	not	forbid	the	honoring	of	the	saints,	but	rather approves	of	it;	because	by	honoring	the	saints,	who	are	the	chosen	friends	of God,	we	honor	God	Himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>Q.	1190.	What	does	"invocation"	mean?	A.	Invocation	means	calling	upon another	for	help	or	protection,	particularly	when	we	are	in	need	or	danger.	It	is used	specially	with	regard	to	calling	upon	God	or	the	saints,	and	hence	it	means prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1191.	How	do	we	show	that	by	honoring	the	Saints	we	honor	God Himself? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	honor	the	Saints	because	they	honor	God.	Therefore,	it	is	for	His sake	that	we	honor	them,	and	hence	by	honoring	them	we	honor	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1192.	Give	another	reason	why	we	honor	God	by	honoring	the	Saints.	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	reason	why	we	honor	God	by	honoring	the	Saints	is	this:	As	we	honor our	country	by	honoring	its	heroes,	so	do	we	honor	our	religion	by	honoring	its Saints.	By	honoring	our	religion	we	honor	God,	who	taught	it.	Therefore,	by honoring	the	Saints	we	honor	God,	for	love	of	whom	they	became	religious heroes	in	their	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1193.	{332}	Does	the	first	Commandment	forbid	us	to	pray	to	the saints? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	first	Commandment	does	not	forbid	us	to	pray	to	the	saints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1194.	Why	does	the	first	commandment	not	forbid	us	to	pray	to	the	Saints? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	first	commandment	does	not	forbid	us	to	pray	to	the	Saints,	because	if	we are	allowed	to	ask	the	prayers	of	our	fellow-creatures	upon	earth	we	should	be allowed	also	to	ask	the	prayers	of	our	fellow-creatures	in	heaven.	Moreover,	the Saints	must	have	an	interest	in	our	welfare,	because	whatever	tends	to	make	us good,	tends	also	to	the	glory	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1195.	{333}	What	do	we	mean	by	praying	to	the	saints?	A.	By	praying	to	the saints	we	mean	the	asking	of	their	help	and	prayers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1196.	Do	we	not	slight	God	Himself	by	addressing	our	prayers	to	saints?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	do	not	slight	God	Himself	by	addressing	our	prayers	to	saints,	but,	on	the contrary,	show	a	greater	respect	for	His	majesty	and	sanctity,	acknowledging,	by our	prayers	to	the	saints,	that	we	are	unworthy	to	address	Him	for	ourselves,	and that	we,	therefore,	ask	His	holy	friends	to	obtain	for	us	what	we	ourselves	are not	worthy	to	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1197.	{334}	How	do	we	know	that	the	saints	hear	us?	A.	We	know	that	the saints	hear	us,	because	they	are	with	God,	who	makes	our	prayers	known	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1198.	{335}	Why	do	we	believe	that	the	saints	will	help	us?	A.	We	believe that	the	saints	will	help	us	because	both	they	and	we	are	members	of	the	same Church,	and	they	love	us	as	their	brethren. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1199.	{336}	How	are	the	saints	and	we	members	of	the	same	Church?	A.	The saints	and	we	are	members	of	the	same	Church,	because	the	Church	in	heaven and	the	Church	on	earth	are	one	and	the	same	Church,	and	all	its	members	are	in communion	with	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1200.	{337}	What	is	the	communion	of	the	members	of	the	Church called? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	communion	of	the	members	of	the	Church	is	called	the	Communion	of Saints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1201.	{338}	What	does	the	communion	of	saints	mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	communion	of	saints	means	the	union	which	exists	between	the members	of	the	Church	on	earth	with	one	another,	and	with	the	blessed	in Heaven,	and	with	the	suffering	souls	in	Purgatory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1202.	{339}	What	benefits	are	derived	from	the	communion	of	saints?	A.	The following	benefits	are	derived	from	the	communion	of	saints:	the	faithful	on earth	assist	one	another	by	their	prayers	and	good	works,	and	they	are	aided	by the	intercession	of	the	saints	in	Heaven,	while	both	the	saints	in	Heaven	and	the faithful	on	earth	help	the	souls	in	Purgatory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1203.	How	can	we	best	honor	the	Saints,	and	where	shall	we	learn their	virtues? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	can	best	honor	the	Saints	by	imitating	their	virtues,	and	we	shall learn	their	virtues	from	the	written	accounts	of	their	lives.	Among	the Saints	we	shall	find	models	for	every	age,	condition	or	state	of	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1204.	{340}	Does	the	first	Commandment	forbid	us	to	honor	relics?	A.	The first	Commandment	does	not	forbid	us	to	honor	relics,	because	relics	are	the bodies	of	the	saints	or	objects	directly	connected	with	them	or	with	our	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1205.	How	many	kinds	or	classes	of	relics	are	there?	A.	There	are	three	kinds or	classes	of	relics:	(1)	The	body	or	part	of	the	body	of	a	saint;	(2)	articles,	such as	clothing	or	books,	used	by	the	saint;	(3)	articles	that	have	touched	a	relic	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>the	body	or	other	relic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1206.	What	is	there	special	about	a	relic	of	the	true	cross	on	which	Our	Lord Died,	and	also	about	the	instruments	of	His	Passion?	A.	The	relics	of	the	true Cross	and	relics	of	the	thorns,	nails,	&amp;c.,	used	in	the	Passion	are	entitled	to	a very	special	veneration,	and	they	have	certain	privileges	with	regard	to	their	use and	the	manner	of	keeping	them	that	other	relics	have	not.	A	relic	of	the	true Cross	is	never	kept	or	carried	with	other	relics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1207.	What	veneration	does	the	Church	permit	us	to	give	to	relics?	A.	The Church	permits	us	to	give	relics	a	veneration	similar	to	that	we	give	images.	We do	not	venerate	the	relics	for	their	own	sake,	but	for	the	sake	of	the	persons	they represent.	The	souls	of	canonized	saints	are	certainly	in	heaven,	and	we	are certain	that	their	bodies	also	will	be	there.	Therefore,	we	may	honor	their	bodies because	they	are	to	be	glorified	in	heaven	and	were	sanctified	upon	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1208.	What	care	does	the	Church	take	in	the	examination	and	distribution	of relics?	A.	The	Church	takes	the	greatest	care	in	the	examination	and	distribution of	relics.	(1)	The	canonization	or	beatification	of	the	person	whose	relic	we receive	must	be	certain;	(2)	the	relics	are	sent	in	sealed	packets,	that	must	be opened	only	by	the	bishop	of	the	diocese	to	which	the	relics	are	sent,	and	each relic	or	packet	must	be	accompanied	by	a	document	or	written	paper	proving	its genuineness;	(3)	the	relics	cannot	be	exposed	for	public	veneration	until	the bishop	examines	them	and	pronounces	them	authentic;	that	is,	that	they	are	what they	are	claimed	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1209.	What	should	we	be	certain	of	before	using	any	relic	or	giving	it	to another?	A.	Before	using	any	relic	or	giving	it	to	another	we	should	be	certain that	all	the	requirements	of	the	Church	concerning	it	have	been	fulfilled,	and	that the	relic	really	is,	as	far	as	it	is	possible	for	any	one	to	know,	what	we	believe	it to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1210.	Has	God	Himself	honored	relics?	A.	God	Himself	has	frequently honored	relics	by	permitting	miracles	to	be	wrought	through	them.	There	is	an example	given	in	the	Bible,	in	the	IV	Book	of	Kings,	where	it	is	related	that	a dead	man	was	restored	to	life	when	his	body	touched	the	bones,	that	is,	the	relics of	the	holy	prophet	Eliseus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1211.	{341}	Does	the	first	Commandment	forbid	the	making	of	images?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>The	first	Commandment	does	forbid	the	making	of	images	if	they	are	made	to	be adored	as	gods,	but	it	does	not	forbid	the	making	of	them	to	put	us	in	mind	of Jesus	Christ,	His	Blessed	Mother,	and	the	saints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1212.	How	do	we	show	that	it	is	only	the	worship	and	not	the	making	of images	that	is	forbidden	by	the	first	commandment?	A.	We	show	that	it	is	only the	worship	and	not	the	making	of	images	that	is	forbidden	by	the	first commandment,	(1)	Because	no	one	thinks	it	sinful	to	carve	statues	or	make photographs	or	paintings	of	relatives	or	friends;	(2)	because	God	Himself commanded	the	making	of	images	for	the	temple	after	He	had	given	the	first commandment,	and	God	never	contradicts	Himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1213.	{342}	Is	it	right	to	show	respect	to	the	pictures	and	images	of Christ	and	His	saints? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	It	is	right	to	show	respect	to	the	pictures	and	images	of	Christ	and His	saints,	because	they	are	the	representations	and	memorials	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1214.	Have	we	in	this	country	any	civil	custom	similar	to	that	of	honoring	the pictures	and	images	of	saints?	A.	We	have,	in	this	country,	a	civil	custom	similar to	that	of	honoring	pictures	and	images	of	saints,	for,	on	Decoration	or	Memorial Day,	patriotic	citizens	place	flowers,	flags,	or	emblems	about	the	statues	of	our deceased	civil	heroes,	to	honor	the	persons	these	statues	represent;	for	just	as	we can	dishonor	a	man	by	abusing	his	image,	so	we	can	honor	him	by	treating	it with	respect	and	reverence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1215.	{343}	Is	it	allowed	to	pray	to	the	crucifix	or	to	the	images	and	relics	of the	saints?	A.	It	is	not	allowed	to	pray	to	the	crucifix	or	images	and	relics	of	the saints,	for	they	have	no	life,	nor	power	to	help	us,	nor	sense	to	hear	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1216.	{344}	Why	do	we	pray	before	the	crucifix	and	the	images	and	relics	of the	saints?	A.	We	pray	before	the	crucifix	and	the	images	and	relics	of	the	saints because	they	enliven	our	devotion	by	exciting	pious	affections	and	desires,	and by	reminding	us	of	Christ	and	of	the	saints,	that	we	may	imitate	their	virtues. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>Q.	1217.	{345}	What	is	the	second	Commandment?	A.	The	second Commandment	is:	Thou	shalt	not	take	the	name	of	the	Lord	thy	God	in	vain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1218.	What	do	you	mean	by	taking	God's	name	in	vain?	A.	By	taking	God's name	in	vain	I	mean	taking	it	without	reverence,	as	in	cursing	or	using	in	a	light and	careless	manner,	as	in	exclamation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1219.	{346}	What	are	we	commanded	by	the	second	Commandment? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	are	commanded	by	the	second	Commandment	to	speak	with	reverence	of God	and	of	the	saints,	and	of	all	holy	things,	and	to	keep	our	lawful oaths	and	vows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1220.	Is	it	sinful	to	use	the	words	of	Holy	Scripture	in	a	bad	or	worldly sense?	A.	It	is	sinful	to	use	the	words	of	Holy	Scripture	in	a	bad	or	worldly sense,	to	joke	in	them	or	ridicule	their	sacred	meaning,	or	in	general	to	give	them any	meaning	but	the	one	we	believe	God	has	intended	them	to	convey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1221.	{347}	What	is	an	oath? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	An	oath	is	the	calling	upon	God	to	witness	the	truth	of	what	we	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1222.	How	is	an	oath	usually	taken?	A.	An	oath	is	usually	taken	by	laying	the hand	on	the	Bible	or	by	lifting	the	hand	towards	heaven	as	a	sign	that	we	call God	to	witness	that	what	we	are	saying	is	under	oath	and	to	the	best	of	our knowledge	really	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1223.	What	is	perjury?	A.	Perjury	is	the	sin	one	commits	who	knowingly takes	a	false	oath;	that	is,	swears	to	the	truth	of	what	he	knows	to	be	false. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perjury	is	a	crime	against	the	law	of	our	country	and	a	mortal	sin	before	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1224.	Who	have	the	right	to	make	us	take	an	oath?	A.	All	persons	to	whom the	law	of	our	country	has	given	such	authority	have	the	right	to	make	us	take	an oath.	They	are	chiefly	judges,	magistrates	and	public	officials,	whose	duty	it	is	to enforce	the	laws.	In	religious	matters	bishops	and	others	to	whom	authority	is given	have	also	the	right	to	make	us	take	an	oath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1225.	{348}	When	may	we	take	an	oath?	A.	We	may	take	an	oath	when	it	is ordered	by	lawful	authority	or	required	for	God's	honor	or	for	our	own	or	our neighbor's	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1226.	When	may	an	oath	be	required	for	God's	honor	or	for	our	own	or	our</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>neighbor's	good?	A.	An	oath	may	be	required	for	God's	honor	or	for	our	own	or our	neighbor's	good	when	we	are	called	upon	to	defend	our	religion	against	false charges;	or	to	protect	our	own	or	our	neighbor's	property	or	good	name;	or	when we	are	required	to	give	testimony	that	will	enable	the	lawful	authorities	to discover	the	guilt	or	innocence	of	a	person	accused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1227.	Is	it	ever	allowed	to	promise	under	oath,	in	secret	societies	or elsewhere,	to	obey	another	in	whatever	good	or	evil	he	commands?	A.	It	is	never allowed	to	promise	under	oath,	in	secret	societies	or	elsewhere,	to	obey	another in	whatever	good	or	evil	he	commands,	for	by	such	an	oath	we	would	declare ourselves	ready	and	willing	to	commit	sin,	if	ordered	to	do	so,	while	God commands	us	to	avoid	even	the	danger	of	sinning.	Hence	the	Church	forbids	us to	join	any	society	in	which	such	oaths	are	taken	by	its	members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1228.	What	societies	in	general	are	we	forbidden	to	join?	A.	In	general	we	are forbidden	to	join	(1)	All	societies	condemned	by	the	Church;	(2)	all	societies	of which	the	object	is	unlawful	and	the	means	used	sinful;	(3)	societies	in	which	the rights	and	freedom	of	our	conscience	are	violated	by	rash	or	dangerous	oaths;	(4) societies	in	which	any	false	religious	ceremony	or	form	of	worship	is	used. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1229.	Are	trades	unions	and	benefit	societies	forbidden?	A.	Trades	unions and	benefit	societies	are	not	in	themselves	forbidden	because	they	have	lawful ends,	which	they	can	secure	by	lawful	means.	The	Church	encourages	every society	that	lawfully	aids	its	members	spiritually	or	temporally,	and	censures	or disowns	every	society	that	uses	sinful	or	unlawful	means	to	secure	even	a	good end;	for	the	Church	can	never	permit	anyone	to	do	evil	that	good	may	come	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1230.	Is	it	lawful	to	vow	or	promise	strict	obedience	to	a	religious	superior? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	It	is	lawful	to	vow	or	promise	strict	obedience	to	a	religious	superior,	because such	superior	can	exact	obedience	only	in	things	that	have	the	sanction	of	God	or of	His	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1231.	{349}	What	is	necessary	to	make	an	oath	lawful?	A.	To	make	an	oath lawful	it	is	necessary	that	what	we	swear	to	be	true,	and	that	there	be	a	sufficient cause	for	taking	an	oath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1232.	{350}	What	is	a	vow?	A.	A	vow	is	a	deliberate	promise	made	to	God	to do	something	that	is	pleasing	to	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1233.	Which	are	the	vows	most	frequently	made?	A.	The	vows	most</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>frequently	made	are	the	three	vows	of	poverty,	chastity	and	obedience,	taken	by persons	living	in	religious	communities	or	consecrated	to	God.	Persons	living	in the	world	are	sometimes	permitted	to	make	such	vows	privately,	but	this	should never	be	done	without	the	advice	and	consent	of	their	confessor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1234.	What	do	the	vows	of	poverty,	chastity	and	obedience	require?	A.	The vows	of	poverty,	chastity	and	obedience	require	that	those	who	make	them	shall not	possess	or	keep	any	property	or	goods	for	themselves	alone;	that	they	shall not	marry	or	be	guilty	of	any	immodest	acts,	and	that	they	shall	strictly	obey their	lawful	superiors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1235.	Has	it	always	been	a	custom	with	pious	Christians	to	make	vows	and promises	to	God?	A.	It	has	always	been	a	custom	with	pious	Christians	to	make vows	and	promises	to	God;	to	beg	His	help	for	some	special	end,	or	to	thank Him	for	some	benefit	received.	They	have	promised	pilgrimages,	good	works	or alms	and	they	have	vowed	to	erect	churches,	convents,	hospitals	or	schools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1236.	What	is	a	pilgrimage?	A.	A	pilgrimage	is	a	journey	to	a	holy	place made	in	a	religious	manner	and	for	a	religious	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1237.	{351}	Is	it	a	sin	not	to	fulfill	our	vows?	A.	Not	to	fulfill	our	vows	is	a sin,	mortal	or	venial,	according	to	the	nature	of	the	vow	and	the	intention	we	had in	making	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1238.	Are	we	bound	to	keep	an	unlawful	oath	or	vow?	A.	We	are	not	bound, but,	on	the	contrary,	positively	forbidden	to	keep	an	unlawful	oath	or	vow.	We are	guilty	of	sin	in	taking	such	an	oath	or	making	such	a	vow,	and	we	would	be guilty	of	still	greater	sin	by	keeping	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1239.	{352}	What	is	forbidden	by	the	second	Commandment?	A.	The	second Commandment	forbids	all	false,	rash,	unjust,	and	unnecessary	oaths,	blasphemy, cursing,	and	profane	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1240.	When	is	an	oath	rash,	unjust	or	unnecessary?	A.	An	oath	is	rash	when we	are	not	sure	of	the	truth	of	what	we	swear;	it	is	unjust	when	it	injures	another unlawfully;	and	it	is	unnecessary	when	there	is	no	good	reason	for	taking	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1241.	What	is	blasphemy,	and	what	are	profane	words?	A.	Blasphemy	is	any word	or	action	intended	as	an	insult	to	God.	To	say	He	is	cruel	or	find	fault	with His	works	is	blasphemy.	It	is	a	much	greater	sin	than	cursing	or	taking	God's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>name	in	vain.	Profane	words	mean	here	bad,	irreverent	or	irreligious	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1242.	{353}	What	is	the	third	Commandment? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	third	Commandment	is:	Remember	thou	keep	holy	the	Sabbath	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1243.	{354}	What	are	we	commanded	by	the	third	Commandment?	A.	By	the third	Commandment	we	are	commanded	to	keep	holy	the	Lord's	day	and	the holydays	of	obligation,	on	which	we	are	to	give	our	time	to	the	service	and worship	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1244.	What	are	holydays	of	obligation?	A.	Holydays	of	obligation	are	special feasts	of	the	Church	on	which	we	are	bound,	under	pain	of	mortal	sin,	to	hear Mass	and	to	keep	from	servile	or	bodily	labors	when	it	can	be	done	without	great loss	or	inconvenience.	Whoever,	on	account	of	their	circumstances,	cannot	give up	work	on	holydays	of	obligation	should	make	every	effort	to	hear	Mass	and should	also	explain	in	confession	the	necessity	of	working	on	holydays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1245.	{355}	How	are	we	to	worship	God	on	Sundays	and	holydays	of obligation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	are	to	worship	God	on	Sundays	and	holydays	of	obligation	by hearing	Mass,	by	prayer,	and	by	other	good	works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1246.	Name	some	of	the	good	works	recommended	for	Sunday.	A.	Some	of the	good	works	recommended	for	Sunday	are:	The	reading	of	religious	books	or papers,	teaching	Catechism,	bringing	relief	to	the	poor	or	sick,	visiting	the Blessed	Sacrament,	attending	Vespers,	Rosary	or	other	devotions	in	the	Church; also	attending	the	meetings	of	religious	sodalities	or	societies.	It	is	not	necessary to	spend	the	whole	Sunday	in	such	good	works,	but	we	should	give	some	time	to them,	that	for	the	love	of	God	we	may	do	a	little	more	than	what	is	strictly commanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1247.	Is	it	forbidden,	then,	to	seek	any	pleasure	or	enjoyment	on	Sunday?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	not	forbidden	to	seek	lawful	pleasure	or	enjoyment	on	Sunday,	especially	to those	who	are	occupied	during	the	week,	for	God	did	not	intend	the	keeping	of the	Sunday	to	be	a	punishment,	but	a	benefit	to	us.	Therefore,	after	hearing	Mass we	may	take	such	recreation	as	is	necessary	or	useful	for	us;	but	we	should	avoid any	vulgar,	noisy	or	disgraceful	amusements	that	turn	the	day	of	rest	and	prayer into	a	day	of	scandal	and	sin. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>day	and	the	Sunday	are	not	the	same.	The	Sabbath	is	the	seventh	day	of	the week,	and	is	the	day	which	was	kept	holy	in	the	old	law;	the	Sunday	is	the	first day	of	the	week,	and	is	the	day	which	is	kept	holy	in	the	new	law. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	1251.	Do	we	keep	Sunday	instead	of	Saturday	holy	for	any	other reason? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore,	reading,	writing,	studying	and,	in	general,	all	works	that	slaves	did not	perform	are	not	considered	servile	works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1255.	{360}	Are	servile	works	on	Sunday	ever	lawful?	A.	Servile	works	are lawful	on	Sundays	when	the	honor	of	God,	the	good	of	our	neighbor,	or necessity	requires	them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Q.	1380.	Will	the	damned	suffer	in	both	mind	and	body?	A.	The	damned	will suffer	in	both	mind	and	body,	because	both	mind	and	body	had	a	share	in	their sins.	The	mind	suffers	the	"pain	of	loss"	in	which	it	is	tortured	by	the	thought	of having	lost	God	forever,	and	the	body	suffers	the	"pain	of	sense"	by	which	it	is tortured	in	all	its	members	and	senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1381.	{414}	What	is	Purgatory?	A.	Purgatory	is	the	state	in	which	those suffer	for	a	time	who	die	guilty	of	venial	sins,	or	without	having	satisfied	for	the punishment	due	to	their	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1382.	Why	is	this	state	called	Purgatory?	A.	This	state	is	called	Purgatory because	in	it	the	souls	are	purged	or	purified	from	all	their	stains;	and	it	is	not, therefore,	a	permanent	or	lasting	state	for	the	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1383.	Are	the	souls	in	Purgatory	sure	of	their	salvation?	A.	The	souls	in Purgatory	are	sure	of	their	salvation,	and	they	will	enter	heaven	as	soon	as	they are	completely	purified	and	made	worthy	to	enjoy	that	presence	of	God	which	is called	the	Beatific	Vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1384.	Do	we	know	what	souls	are	in	Purgatory,	and	how	long	they	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>remain	there?	A.	We	do	not	know	what	souls	are	in	Purgatory	nor	how	long	they have	to	remain	there;	hence	we	continue	to	pray	for	all	persons	who	have	died apparently	in	the	true	faith	and	free	from	mortal	sin.	They	are	called	the	faithful departed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1385.	{415}	Can	the	faithful	on	earth	help	the	souls	in	Purgatory?	A.	The faithful	on	earth	can	help	the	souls	in	Purgatory	by	their	prayers,	fasts,	alms, deeds;	by	indulgences,	and	by	having	Masses	said	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1386.	Since	God	loves	the	souls	in	Purgatory,	why	does	He	punish	them?	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	God	loves	the	souls	in	Purgatory,	He	punishes	them	because	His holiness	requires	that	nothing	defiled	may	enter	heaven	and	His	justice	requires that	everyone	be	punished	or	rewarded	according	to	what	he	deserves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1387.	{416}	If	every	one	is	judged	immediately	after	death,	what	need	is there	of	a	general	judgment?	A.	There	is	need	of	a	general	judgment,	though every	one	is	judged	immediately	after	death,	that	the	providence	of	God,	which, on	earth,	often	permits	the	good	to	suffer	and	the	wicked	to	prosper,	may	in	the end	appear	just	before	all	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1388.	What	is	meant	by	"the	Providence	of	God"?	A.	By	"the	Providence	of God"	is	meant	the	manner	in	which	He	preserves,	provides	for,	rules	and	governs the	world	and	directs	all	things	by	His	infinite	Will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1389.	Are	there	other	reasons	for	the	general	judgment? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	There	are	other	reasons	for	the	general	judgment,	and	especially	that Christ	Our	Lord	may	receive	from	the	whole	world	the	honor	denied	Him	at His	first	coming,	and	that	all	may	be	forced	to	acknowledge	Him	their God	and	Redeemer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1390.	{417}	Will	our	bodies	share	in	the	reward	or	punishment	of	our souls? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Our	bodies	will	share	in	the	reward	or	punishment	of	our	souls, because	through	the	resurrection	they	will	again	be	united	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1391.	When	will	the	general	resurrection	or	rising	of	all	the	dead	take	place? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	general	resurrection	or	rising	of	all	the	dead	will	take	place	at	the	general judgment,	when	the	same	bodies	in	which	we	lived	on	earth	will	come	forth from	the	grave	and	be	united	to	our	souls	and	remain	united	with	them	forever either	in	heaven	or	in	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>Q.	1392.	{418}	In	what	state	will	the	bodies	of	the	just	rise? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	The	bodies	of	the	just	will	rise	glorious	and	immortal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1393.	{419}	Will	the	bodies	of	the	damned	also	rise?	A.	The	bodies	of	the damned	will	also	rise,	but	they	will	be	condemned	to	eternal	punishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1394.	Why	do	we	show	respect	for	the	bodies	of	the	dead? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	We	show	respect	for	the	bodies	of	the	dead	because	they	were	the dwelling-place	of	the	soul,	the	medium	through	which	it	received	the Sacraments,	and	because	they	were	created	to	occupy	a	place	in	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1395.	{420}	What	is	Heaven?	A.	Heaven	is	the	state	of	everlasting	life	in which	we	see	God	face	to	face,	are	made	like	unto	Him	in	glory,	and	enjoy eternal	happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1396.	In	what	does	the	happiness	in	heaven	consist?	A.	The	happiness	in heaven	consists	in	seeing	the	beauty	of	God,	in	knowing	Him	as	He	is,	and	in having	every	desire	fully	satisfied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1397.	What	does	St.	Paul	say	of	heaven?	A.	St.	Paul	says	of	heaven,	"That eye	hath	not	seen,	nor	ear	heard,	neither	hath	it	entered	into	the	heart	of	man what	things	God	hath	prepared	for	them	that	love	Him."	(I.	Cor.	ii.,	9.) Q.	1398.	Are	the	rewards	in	heaven	and	the	punishments	in	hell	the	same	for	all who	enter	into	either	of	these	states?	A.	The	rewards	of	heaven	and	the punishments	in	hell	are	not	the	same	for	all	who	enter	into	either	of	these	states, because	each	one's	reward	or	punishment	is	in	proportion	to	the	amount	of	good or	evil	he	has	done	in	this	world.	But	as	heaven	and	hell	are	everlasting,	each one	will	enjoy	his	reward	or	suffer	his	punishment	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1399.	{421}	What	words	should	we	bear	always	in	mind?	A.	We	should	bear always	in	mind	these	words	of	our	Lord	and	Saviour	Jesus	Christ:	"What	doth	it profit	a	man	if	he	gain	the	whole	world	and	suffer	the	loss	of	his	own	soul,	or what	exchange	shall	a	man	give	for	his	soul?	For	the	Son	of	man	shall	come	in the	glory	of	His	Father	with	His	angels;	and	then	will	He	render	to	every	man according	to	his	works." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q.	1400.	Name	some	of	the	more	essential	religious	truths	we	must	know and	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.	Some	of	the	more	essential	religious	truths	we	must	know	and	believe</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1)	That	there	is	but	one	God,	and	He	will	reward	the	good	and	punish	the wicked.	(2)	That	in	God	there	are	three	Divine	Persons:	the	Father,	the	Son,	and the	Holy	Ghost,	and	these	Divine	Persons	are	called	the	Blessed	Trinity.	(3)	That Jesus	Christ,	the	Second	Person	of	the	Blessed	Trinity,	became	man	and	died	for our	redemption.	(4)	That	the	grace	of	God	is	necessary	for	our	salvation.	(5)	That the	human	soul	is	immortal. </p>
